"DO NOT COME HERE ON THE WEEKEND! We arrived at 10am on a Saturday and waited 15 minutes to order, at which point we were cautioned that the wait for our food would be 30 minutes. This seemed reasonable to us. After waiting an hour with no acknowledgment or update from the staff as to the much longer than anticipated wait, my partner got back in line for another 10 minutes to request our money back. At the register, he was told that our food would be out soon. No apologies, no offer of a free cup of coffee, nothing. Our food was brought to our table another 5 minutes later again without an apology for the wait. We waited an hour and 15 minutes for a small breakfast sandwich and breakfast burrito. As we were leaving, multiple people began complaining at once, at which point one of the staff members finally acknowledged the situation, apologized and offered some free beverages. It wasn't their fault they were slammed, but it is entirely their fault how they handled it. Very poor, entitled management. We won't be coming back on the weekend again. You've been warned."
"The convenience store part of it is super cute and convenient.They offer local and/or environment friendly products have everything you need including refills of dish sop, dishwasher soap etc… bring your own container! Waste less plastic! They offer fresh bread, have a nice offering of beers and wine."
"I love this place. Their breakfast sandwiches are *chefs kiss*. Everyone is so kind and the food is delicious. Weekend mornings do have long lines, so prepare to wait or order online in advance! Limited seating inside and an outside patio area.
The front market is also great!"

"We love cushmans! We frequent here at least 4 times a week, and as a business owner I can appreciate the hard work the staff here does on a daily basis. I don’t see why people complain about tipping options for the staff at the counter . I would rather tip the people that are working to get my meal out for me than to not have anyone working at the establishment in general.Breakfast sandwich with my iced latte is a home run every time!!!"

"Staff are friendly, love the warm and cozy atmosphere and their challah french toast is the best french toast I have ever had. Lovely aesthetic and easy going vibe. Definitely one of the core establishments one should visit to get the full Amherst experience."
"Every visit to U Mass we stop at Cushman Market for breakfast. The food is always tasty, the breads and coffee are delicious, and there's always something to find on the market side.
Customer service is really friendly as well."

"Always such a lovely experience! Café serves delicious food and pastries, coffee is best in town and great selection of wine, specialty foods and very fun and novel gifts.
A true town gem!"
I love the cafe here! Delicious sandwiches and the store has a fun variety of items from wholesome grocery staples to fancy local beer/cider. Even silly socks and silly room fresheners.
"Really cute neighborhood market with a cozy Cafe in the back. Has some basic pantry and produce options if you need a quick buy, but this place is also a great location for lunch.

Vegetarian options: Many vegetarian sandwhich options s available

Parking: Parking along the front, side, and in the back

Wheelchair accessibility: Ramp in the back where the entrance to the cafe is."

Quaint and a wonderful selection of organic foods wines and beverages. Great little novelties for gifts or fun. There is a cafe in the back with amazing fresh made selections all day. Coffee station with a fabulous selection fresh to grind. You will miss out on a special little spot if you haven't been here yet😉
"kind of a nice neighborhood upscale bodega, eclectic deli, and breakfast and lunch place in the back. the market section has high quality stuff handpicked, and is quite pricey. selected wines and cheeses and yogurts and bread and such canned goods a few necessities, all will not disappoint except if you wanted something cheaper :-) the breakfast and lunch restaurant in the back is really quite good. some vegetarian sandwiches, some sandwiches made with turkey - and that seems to be a pretty common sandwich filling here ( and the turkey is real, self-roasted, unprocessed turkey breast) - and also some classics like BLT etc. the real standout is breakfast. the holla French toast is to die for! thick slices perfectly cooked real maple syrup huge portion. blueberry pancakes made with a good amount of blueberries on the weekends. really yummy breakfast sandwiches made with all kinds of combination of things. including smoked salmon, herbed cream cheese, cheddar, bacon, ham, veggie sausage. great eggs great omelets. they also have bowls called hobo bowls, with kale and potatoes and cheese and meat and such. I think I got to try those they sound intriguing. the lunch sandwiches are also yummy although sometimes a little small sometimes normal size they vary a bit :-) the small selection of grocery is and such seems well thought out but of course it's pretty upscale and pricey. if you're getting just a few items maybe better that then having really lousy stuff to finish your recipe with, true? and you can buy wine and such! there's a nice patio to the side of the restaurant in the Cushman Green is right there and so is the bus. puffers Pond a short walk away what's not to like?"
"A little slice of hippie heaven! I had a wonderful time at the Cushman Cafe.  It's welcoming, comfortable place with many vegan and vegetarian options. It's also a neighborhood place, with families, teens, older folks and laptop workers (like me) enjoying the good food, coffee and tea drinks and solid wifi. I felt as though I'd been transported to Marin County in California. I'll be back!"
Please do yourself a favor and come here to Cushman Market and Cafe. . Cushman has great coffee and outstanding food. The breakfast sandwiches are particularly good. The staff is outstanding.  There is also outdoor seating with an occasional passing train to watch.  Cushman is also a neighborhood grocery store that carries a wide selection fo high quality products. OT also has a  and a well selected wine section. Fresh bread is always available. Excellent  rotisserie chicken is available by reservation.

"Oh how I miss the old Cushman Cafe. I used to be a regular here because they had great coffee, chai, and a decent lunch and breakfast. The staff used to be awesome too. I understand that the pandemic has caused challenges for many businesses like this, however it is so extremely disappointing seeing the quality of this place go down the tubes. Everything here has become underwhelming. The last straw for me was the last lunch we had. I ordered through their online menu for pick-up and ordered a panini (hot sandwich) and ended up with a cold sandwich with the wrong ingredients. Plus the lettuce was rotten and not washed (had sand) and the bread was stale - completely inedible. The chai was also not very good. We had to throw the whole lunch away. After being a long regular customer I won't be returning any time soon."

Cushman is amazing for so many reasons. Firstly being I love getting lunch there and their drinks are incredible! The market is so convenient because it’s right next to the cafe. Overall I love all the delicious options and things Cushman offers!
"My husband and I each had omelettes and the eggs were not done. The roasted potatoes were bland and cold. I have had fast food breakfast that was better than this. On top of it all, it took forever to get this mess and it was expensive garbage. We would never come here again, nor would I recommend it to anyone."
Nothing like being able to call to get an excellent iced coffee and a breakfast sandwich right around the corner from your house. Still amazing food and service nothing has changed
Lovely little eco-friendly coffee and sandwich shop. Food is delicious and fresh! I recommend trying a CBD shot which they can add into any of their drinks. The outdoor area is also very nice and family friendly. I appreciated that they are continuing to wear masks inside and clean/disinfect things often.
"Great market for staples and spirits selection and super fun and interesting items . The cafe has delicious sandwiches and drinks and even has vegan options. Their online ordering during the pandemic is easy and fast , the vibe is still present . It's a great place to enjoy an outdoors moment and take in this unique corner of Amherst."

"This cafe used to be really good, but now its awful. The food and drinks are fine. However after you pay the staff demand that you tip them! I paid by credit card and the girl told me to put the tip on the card. I said what did you say, and she again said put the tip on the card, 25% is the norm.
I will never go here again.
A friend of mine also had the same experience.  In her case she had paid and was putting milk in the coffee when the sever ran over and said really loudly, you forgot to put the tip on your card. She was horrified and she and her friends will also not be going here."

Great breakfast and lunch. It’s all delicious.
The sandwiches are amazing!! Highly recommend the safe hit and Rizzo toasted. Great local business by great people. Owners and staff are very kind. Nice atmosphere inside as well.
"First of all, I love the blueberry  pancakes they have here on Sunday.

The service is pretty fast. Servers are friendly for the most part.

Sadly, I'm not that crazy about the rest of the things they have. Plus the vibe is a bit crunchy granola, but I guess if you're into that, then great LOL"

I found is disappointing both times that I went there. The menu has some things that sound delicious but the actual food is underwhelming. It's expensive but doesn't provide a product worthy of the steep price.
"The most crispy, yummy, sandwiches in my life. Amazing vibrations here. Good place to be. 10/10 and if you go on Sunday morning there's music!!"
"I love this place.  Great sandwiches,  if a little greasy due to being grilled with lots of butter.  The outdoor patio is so nice as long as it isn't too hot and sunny.  They have a few umbrellas but it isn't sufficient to shade all tables.
Everyone is nice.  I can only imagine that it is a good place to work, because people seem to stay for years.
Very pleasant.   Highly recommended."

"This place is simply fantastic. The staff are friendly and welcoming, drinks and food are consistently great and the atmosphere is conducive to getting work done or catching up with friends. They are also committed to sourcing food locally and minimizing their environmental impact through compostable materials and a comprehensive recycling and composting system. A cornerstone of the Amherst community and always worth a visit."

"Cushman market is a great place for breakfast in Amherst. Their breakfast sandwiches are always made perfectly, if a little slow. I get the Smitty. I have strayed a few times from this iconic sandwich but I’ve never been as pleased as when I get that perfect mix of egg, bacon, hash brown, and egg. I would go so far as to recommend not making any substitutions or add one to your breakfast sandwich. They also have other breakfast choices but they pale in comparison to the perfect cheap breakfast"

"Waited for over a half hour for a sandwich watch several people order the same thing and receive it. The owners barely apologized, and basically blamed me for not ordering ahead of time at lunch hour and did nothing. I literally watch like 7 groups of customers order the same or similar thing and get their food. Unacceptable. My crew no longer eats there for lunch. Note this was before the pandemic but it shows you the mentality of the owners."

"There is a nice market in the front. In the back is a small restaurant. There is a nice variety of food here, including both vegetarian and vegan options. They also have a breakfast menu, desserts, and a nice coffee menu. I recommend the maple latte.  I had the vegetarian reuben sandwich (a slice of tofu with Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and dressing on rye bread) and my partner has the black bean burger. They were good, but nothing special.  Each sandwich came with tortilla chips and a pickle. The coffee was quite good though. It was crowded when we were there; I have a feeling this is a local favorite. They have free WiFi here. There were lots of college aged students working on their laptops despite the noise and crowded atmosphere. All in all it isn't a bad place to eat, but the food we ordered was nothing special. Like I mentioned above, the latte was fantastic."

Always a wonderful experience. Delicious foods - anything with egg and potato combo is spectacular. The best coffee anywhere. Outdoor seating is especially nice in spring when forsythia  blooms against the old blue siding. And the train runs past!
"Cushman's is not only a great place to eat, but also a great place to go and do work. It can be crowded so be prepared but if you can get a table you will enjoy your time. Their iced mochas are delicious as well as their hot maple lattes. I have eaten there for both breakfast and lunch and have never been disappointed. I would highly recommend their breakfast sandwiches. They're delicious!"
"BEST OMELETTE THING I'VE EVER HAD.
I ordered the ""By_The_Sea"" and it was easily the most delicious breakfast meal I've ever had. The meal included 3 scrambled eggs with smoked salmon and caramelized onions along with a cream cheese bagel.
It was for a relatively moderate price of $9.50, but definitely worth it due to its quality.
The only problem I had was wait time; in line only. After I ordered, the food came out relatively quick."

"I'd give the cafe 1 or 2 stars, but I really like the market. Waited 10+ minutes for a plain bagel with peanut butter on the side. This is not the first time I've had an incredibly long wait. And, around lunch, when they're really busy, I get it. However, I could see back into the kitchen and they weren't working on anyone's food.
That happens sometimes. It's great that everyone seems to get along with their co-workers so well. However, this is not the first time I've seen socializing get in the way of staff actually doing their job."

"Cool little market with offbeat gifts, staple groceries, goodies, a good selection of wine, and takeaway food with a busy cafe in the back. Lots of local products like cheese, honey, milk, sausage, and meat. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is there is very little produce available. Love going here - the people are so nice!!"
Warm and friendly atmosphere in a well decorated country-ish cafe restaurant. The food was pretty good but the omelettes were missing a little something that makes a really good omelette. Jazz was a very nice addition!
Beautiful little market to buy snacks and things. The restaurant section is also very cozy and the food is fresh and delicious. Lots of different options for different dietary needs and plenty of good feelings abound. Great business with friendly employees!
"I went here yesterday for the first time with a friend who goes here often and recommended it, but our experience was so bad and so preventable. Note: I understand the circumstances and stress placed upon a restaurant because of COVID. Also, I have been managing restaurants for the past few years, with the same POS & online ordering system they use, Toast).

I ordered my 1 sandwich online through their online takeout portal with Toast at 1:15. I got an email saying that my sandwich (cold, not a panini) would be ready in 10 minutes at 1:25. My friend went inside to order right after I had done the online ordering and she placed an order for 3 sandwiches (2 cold and 1 panini). I got an email 5 minutes after I had placed my online order saying that my order had not been approved by the restaurant yet, and to contact them. So, I went inside, and was rudely ushered out by the girl working once she realized I was there for an online order and didn't have to order at the counter. I had to force an interaction with her to get my inquiry about my order across, and when she went to check on my order she said that they were working or starting on it. About 10 more minutes go by and I ask the guy working and he knows nothing. Then my friend's 3 sandwiches (that she ordered after me) are ready. Then the girl comes out so I ask her and she too knows nothing and was again was rude in her interaction with me. Finally, 30-35 minutes AFTER I initially placed my order, my 1 sandwich, that didn't even have to be pressed in a panini maker, is ready. I understand if this was a big order but for 1 sandwich, that is absurd.

I don't know how many people were in the kitchen, and it was just the two of them working the front of house but they were clearly in the weeds. The girl was straight up rude and the guy looked frazzled beyond belief. It's great they were getting busy and had business, but they 100% could have, & should have, handled my order better.

A restaurant can have great food but it can be reduced to nothing if it has bad hospitality and that is what I experienced. Having been in the weeds while working in restaurants myself, I understand that there is a lot going on and you can't give your full attention to everything. However, making sure that guests still feel acknowledged, welcome, and heard, is of THE MOST importance. It doesn't matter how small or big, fancy or casual the restaurant is- hospitality is important! My sandwich was good but it was also a sandwich that can easily be replicated at home (Lady Rowena: goat cheese, pesto, tomato & green leaf lettuce on a baguette). So, why would I spend money to get poor customer service on a meal I can make just as easily?

Additionally, I would say that the staff working are not properly trained in Toast. It seemed like most guests who were waiting ordered by phone or online ordering. Toast has a setting to throttle online takeout orders- aka rather than giving me a 10 minute estimate, Toast could have told me, 15, 20, 25, you name it- had they throttled the ordering system. Also, the fact that my order had to be manually approved on the POS system, without the ticket being sent straight to the kitchen, may have also been a factor in this mess and thats something they should consider operations-wise. Understand what your POS system is capable of and how it can be used to your benefit in smoothly operating your restaurant.

I don't normally write reviews but I will if the experience was atrocious. My experience was also so preventable. There is just lack of training, lack of hospitality (could be great when its calm, but mastering hospitality under stressful conditions is key) and poor operations in place. Again, I understand its COVID and operations are different than normal, but I saw a lot going wrong. Hospitality & knowledge of your own POS system can't be things a restaurant lack even during a pandemic.

Oh- and a sandwich (wrapped up) got dropped on the floor while it was being put into someone's bag for their order, and they didn't even re-wrap it in new deli paper. Yikes."

"Lets start with the bad, wait staff seems inconvenienced being there and serving you, both at  the counter and at the table. I had a feeling of slight discomfort, and at points, unwelcomed.

Now the good, the market is very nice. Gentleman at the counter was kind. The overall design and decoration of market and cafe was cool. Parking wasn't too bad, but this was a weekday. Food was fast and delicious. Music playing was a solid selection, not sure if that was the radio or inhouse.

Honestly, I'll probably be back here again, for the delicious food, but I will be ready for an uninterested person at the counter and I will order it to go."

Great selection of breakfast and lunch items with delicious coffee. Nice seating both inside and outside with cool artwork and decorations.
"Travelers, Cushman's market is a great place to stop along your travels. You can order sandwiches, coffees, and baked goods in the back where there are tables and chairs. There is generally artwork on the walls from local artists and that is a nice touch. The front of the store is a general store/convenience store and has a nice selection of products for a small grab and go store. This is a nice place to go for a Sunday afternoon lunch and the might have live music. Travelers, this is worth the stop."
"I grew up next to this place, and it's wonderful. Great place for breakfast or lunch, with wonderful sandwiches, and excellent coffee. The atmosphere inside is friendly and homey, and if I still lived in this town, I would come to the cafe many times a week."
LOVE this place!! I get breakfast from here multiple times a week! They even have vegan bacon 😍 and the online ordering process is so smooth!
Great food and awesome atmosphere
"Contrary to what I wrote and posted 7 months ago, Cushman Market has declined in quality while their prices have skyrocketed. For no more than 5 items which should have cost $18, I had to pay $40+. I paid because I believe in and support local businesses. But this was my last straw. I will not support highway robbery, nor will I send my friends and associates here - it's just way off and too expensive! There is no need for that kind of price gauging!!!
So I drop my rating to one star, and will not visit again. After over 20 years of patronage, Cushman market has lost my business, sadly.
Previously:
Always has a great selection of local fare, sandwiches, and soups, and so forth. They also have a front end convenience store. Place that is family friendly and healthy quick meal."

"Sweet little cafe in the back of old countryish store with very good food. The current cook is a master of omelettes. Filled with college students, professors, locals, super nice staff. One bogus thing is this: its a busy serve yourself place, order your food and sit down. So coffee refills mean you have to go back up and stand in line (it's usually busy)."

"If a $4 bagel sandwich can be considered a bargain, it's definitely at Cushman Market Cafe.  About an inch of cream cheese and plenty of onion and tomato on a real bagel, it was absolutely delicious.  The cafe has a very creative and mouth watering menu with an impressive selection of breakfast and lunch items, from smoothies & milkshakes to pancakes, omelettes, and bowls of home fries topped with different things, as well as a great sandwich selection and assortment of coffee and tea, all very high quality and served by a friendly and attentive staff who all seem to enjoy where they work. An overall fun place to be.. I was told they even have live music here sometimes, I will have to look into that.

I know one thing for sure... I will be back here again and again and I will bring family and friends to enjoy this great little eatery (and, oh yeah, they have a store)...  in front of the cafe is a small ""country store"" type of shop with an impressive selection of wine and beer and a variety of other essentials at very reasonable prices.  I highly recommend checking this place out, you will not be disappoint."

Great place to grab something to eat!
"Cramped and slow service on a Sunday morning. They clear an area for music and it results in tables so close, some are unusable. Server brings one set of utensils for 2 orders. Good is ok, but I would skip the bagels."
"The cafe in back has funky, ambiance-enhancing music, and the menu features tasty meals, creative pastries, and hot coffee. I was welcomed at the counter by a friendly, engaging young woman who took my order."
"Have liked going to Cushman's Market and cafe for a long time. Its good food and reasonably priced. It can get super crowded at times especially during rush hours. They also have live band playing during breakfast sometimes, mostly local musicians I believe. I will be returning to this cafe for a breakfast sandwich and a muffin sometime soon. I recommend customers doing a pickup and then eating it near the beautiful train tracks in the backside of the cafe :) (weather permitting of course)"
"Cushman market is overall amazing. They have a little store connected to it you can get quick stop groceries and novelty stuff at along with the Café. They have an entire vegan menu which you never see anywhere, a one of a kind place"
"To share some background information, I have been coming to Cushman at least once a week for 2.5 years. I am a graduate student at UMass Amherst and I regularly come here to order food and work.

However, today for the first time I had a off-putting experience, very uncharacteristic of my favorite spot to work. To elaborate, I came in early and ordered food and was working on my laptop at the four person table near the outlet in the middle of the restaurant. About 10 minutes after I was served my food, I was politely asked to consolidate my belongings to one table ( I had my coat and backpack on the chair next to me). Fine. Totally understandable. However, my friend arrived a few minutes later, ordered food and sat diagonally from me at the same table so she had enough room to comfortably eat her breakfast. Again, about 10 minutes into her eating her breakfast, we were both asked to condense into one table. We agreed, and said as soon as we were done eating. Yet, a few moments later, we were told by the same person to move immediately. This is not how regular customers should be treated, REGARDLESS, of how busy the restaurant is. I could understand if we didn't order food and were taking up the entire table but we were in the middle of EATING. Additionally, there were people around in other booths in groups of two that were NOT asked to move.

Also, after I left my friend, the woman who asked us to move the 3 times, proceeded to spray cleaner on my friend's laptop and her face. Shockingly terrible service.

Needless to say, we are both extremely dissatisfied with our experience this morning and will probably not be returning and will spend our money elsewhere.

As a warning to others, if you want to be left alone while taking up a four person table make sure you are one middle-aged man or two older women at a booth and you will be guaranteed not to get asked to move while eating your breakfast. Heartbroken, I won't be returning to my favorite spot for a while."

"This place rocks.  It has all you really need, good epresso, in house made baked goodies, wonderful breakfasts and killer sandwiches.  The fact I can nip in and grab a bottle of wine or a six pack of craft beer on the way home really works for me.  The staff are friendly and helpful.  The market is full of off kilter joke items as well as essential foods like chocalate.  It is hard not to love this delightful little market and cafe."

Some of the best breakfast food in Amherst! Love that it's served until 3 daily and I have never had a bad food experience here. It can get every busy in the morning and during the weekend so plan ahead
"They're ok. They have kids games, which is good for kids although the games are old and need replacement. The coffee's ok, not great. It's the only option for coffee in North Amherst. There are limited outlets for laptops. It is popular with locals. They have vegan options. The desserts are good. You must use a microwave to warm it up. Sandwiches are pretty good. I just tried their potato knish: stay away from it!. The knish is bland, lacking in salt, and is served cold. Based on that, you should probably stick to the fresh prepared non-dessert food."

I wanted a grilled cheese with blackberry jam but all they had was strawberry which was still delicious and I appreciated that they made me a special sandwich :) yummy coffee and cute place
"Cushman Market has been a favorite for years. High quality breakfast, brunch, lunch, and snack options featuring fresh, local ingredients. My only complaint is that their delicious chai is way way too strong caffeine so I had to stop drinking it. Fortunately they seasonally offer chaider- half tea half cider"
"As a New Yorker who grew up on deli style egg sandwiches, Cushman Market is probably your best bet for a quality breakfast sandwich in the area. I've also enjoyed other items on their extensive menu and have always left satisfied."
"Very disappointed. Went to the takeout counter here for lunch and was told it would be over a 30 minute wait for a sandwich. When I expressed my surprise, the employees simply replied, ""It's Sunday. Have a granola bar while you wait."""
"Order online and contact-less pick up inside. Food and service are as great as ever! My go-to ""wanna treat myself to a breakfast sandwich"" place!"
"Such great food, prices, and board games. Cute part of town and very nice service. Go for breakfast or to cool down on a hot day! Know that it's dark in there and you won't get much sunlight"
Delicious sandwiches. The store has lots of interesting food items that I never saw before. Kind of a fun place to visit.
"Between the food service and convenience store, this place is fantastic. The sandwiches are well prepared and delicious. The convenience store has both the necessities as well as the extraordinary and fun."
Great local place with a market and coffee drinks and food.  Eclectic menu options for lunch and breakfast.  Lots of space to hang out in.  Plus a little lending library of board games.  And occasional live music
"Great place for a healthy lunch, laptop coffee/ work break, or comfort food. Even grab the few items you forgot at the market! Local goodness, made with love."
Hole in the wall place with gluten free meals!
"this place is a jewel, had to wait two hours so sat and did email at the cafe. fantastic omelette and had to break the carb free diet because of the bread."
"Always enjoyable. Lunch can be a bit hectic, but the morning isn't too bad. Good prices, nice staff, yummy food and drink. Well worth the visit!"
"Great food in a funky spot. Every breakfast item is under 10 dollars, some simple dishes under 3. Crowded, but that's how you know it's good."
"The food is excellent and so tasty. The price however can be steep, but the morning hangovers are sure to be fixed with a hobo bowl and a smoothie."
Quintessential Amherst. Hippie kosher style food with great (but expensive coffee). Cafe is adjacent to a small market with craft beer and other non essentials. Easy walk to a trail system that leads to puffers pond.
"Very nice sandwiches etc. A nice place also to sit and read Words at War, (Scarecrow Press) my book  US radio's role in helping the war effort in the 1940s.

It also discusses the postwar broadcasting industry blacklist. Based partly on my interviews of Arthur Miller, Pete Seeger, Norman Corwin etc."

"went for the coffee and food, stayed for the old wooden beams (very aesthetic!). love this place."
Lovely meal last night. Risotto was fab and service is always great
"I waited way too long today and the staff was so inattentive and unfriendly, and the covid restrictions are so harsh, I wondered if they always were so miserable.
Never going back"
Really cool place right next to the train tracks great place to hang out it's got food to buy to take out and it's got a very small grocery store as well as a really cozy place to get something to eat good food
The food and drinks are delicious and the staff is always so nice! I drive out of my way to go to Cushman whenever I can
Great place for lunch coffee or a quick snack. They have delicious healthy sandwiches. Kind of an earthy crunchy place.
Pretty good food. Not much breakfast without egg. Pretty nice service. Amazing latte
"OUTSTANDING place to have a great breakfast! Attracts a wonderfully diverse crowd & if Brigette has anything to do with your meal, u are 100% fortunate!"
"Nice place with patio, friendly staff, anf huge selection of creative dishes. You can walk there on a wooded trail from nearby Puffers Pond."
"Nice and fast stuff, love the coffee, and the food is so tasty."
"Cozy locally owned breakfast, lunch, coffee  cafe & convenience store. Good food for quick bite or meeting w friends, colleagues."
"This place rules! Cozy, great coffee, yummy snacks, kewl nick nacks and cider in the grocery section, super friendly service- what’s not to love?"
"Great food, food selection and friendly service. Plus they always have pineapple orange guava, my favorite Nantucket nectars flavor!"
"Long story short - ,the server made a mistake, didn't apologize and then made a point of coming over to me to make a sarcastic comment. One star for the bagel 0 stars for service."
"A favorite spot to grab a bite, enjoy some music, or get some work done. Personal favorite: the BOSS sandwich. Sundays for jazz."
great atmosphere and food. the shop is also very cute. i look forward to their summer stock!
Some of the best coffee drinks in Western Mass paired with a great atmosphere! Their mochas are delicious.
I ordered takeout breakfast for 2. It was ready in <15 mins and it was very tasty.
Best staff in history of staves. Always going the extra mile. Matt is awesome. Casey is awesome. All are awesome. Everything is awesome.
Great coffee.  Courteous staff.  Kitchen puts out some delicious sandwiches and breakfast items.
Food is decent and comes quickly. Service could have been friendlier. Jazz on Sunday way too loud
This is a great gem right next to the college. Gluten free options available!! Great coffee and jazz brunch on Sunday
"Terrific cafe counter help, great sandwiches, fun drinks. The experienced staff accomodate dietary restrictions well."
"It always feels good going in here, with that quaint Western Mass vibe. They have a vegan menu, too, If you're looking for that."
Such tasty sandwiches and coffee! And really friendly service. Love this place!
Fantastic low key relaxed place for breakfast/brunch or coffee. Staff always friendly and fast service.
"Delicious food, friendly atmosphere, great wifi connection for working/surfing the web.  Lots of funny gag-gifts!"
"Very good coffee, food is very expensive and there's always a waiting line. Not so clean or organized. Parking is ok"
"They completely forgot about our order. When the food finally arrived, 40 minutes late, the individual dishes were messed up"
"A great selection of delicious sandwiches, a really nice market, and friendly service."
Fresh food loved it. I actually didn't know they had so much stuff in there. I'll be back !
