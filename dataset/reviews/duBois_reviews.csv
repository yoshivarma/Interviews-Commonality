review_text
Many great hours spent studying in this building. Always a quiet spot to find away from the chatter. It’s also the second tallest library in the world!
"Best library, you can take print out , the staff is very friendly and suggested me to visit 23rd floor as it has the best view, very true. This is a very old building but it's fully equipped with water, washrooms etc. Nice and peaceful also for study purposes."
"Great recourses and lotta books,  innaccurate operating hours, all the macs downstairs here have almost no harddrive space left if you plan to do your Adobe assignments on them.  Please provide more consistent hours."
"Great place for students to study. The view from the top floors are just breathtaking. Also, has a cafe."
In love with this library! They have a quiet space when students can work either alone or in group.
"The world tallest library. There are all kinds of areas for calm study, study discussion and a place for taking a nap."
Great library full of resources and helpful staff.
learning environment is soo good
28 Floors full of book.s Very calm place to study. Almost half of the floors have separate study rooms.  Cafe also available inside.
"27 floors to choose from, and everyone's in the basement.  Go figure.  Usually plenty of quiet floors with a view : )  Also check out the tutoring center!"
Best Library Ever! I believe everyone feel great just to be inside this library because library is designed that gives courage to study.
"Great place, but I didn't like the fact that a security person asked to see my UMass ID when I fell asleep on the chair."
"Access to hundreds of thousands of books, journals, archives, and more! And if DuBois doesn't have it, you can order it through interlibrary loan."
"Nice library with views of all sides, good cafe with nice wraps and alternative options as well"
"Its very clean, hygienic and following the covid norms"
