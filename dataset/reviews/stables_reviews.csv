"First time visit. Very thick clam chowder, just the way I like it. (See attached photo with standing spoon) Hard to find this at other restaurants. Excellent lunch. Will stop again when in the area.Dine in: Yes
Outdoor seating: No",
"Good, not great.  This is a well regarded, and often busy, restaurant that features breakfast and lunch.  I met my 75yo sister there, and told her about how good I expected breakfast to be.  My pancakes were flat and not very tasty, and her french toast was equally disappointing.  It was good, but not 'can't wait to go back there' great.",
"Ordered a plate of waffle and a small breakfast dish (eggs, sausage, hash brown, toast). Plain ‚ÄúBelgian‚Äù waffle came soggy like a moistened dish sponge. Eggs and sausages were good, but hash browns were half burnt. My server never came to check in or fill up the coffee. She‚Äôs also the same one who glanced at me and walked by me three times at the entrance before telling me to ‚Äúsit wherever‚Äù. It just was not a good experience overall.",

"Great breakfast place for an affordable price! We got the homemade Hash n Eggs (off menu item offered daily) and the Farmer Brown breakfast special with waffles substituted for pancakes. Sampled my friends pancake, both the waffles and pancakes were drier than preferred but I think the waffle has better flavor.

Future customers would likely be satisfied with the staple eggs, potatoes (really good! Crispy outside, soft inside), homemade hash, and sourdough toast.",

"A nice Lil niche breakfast spot. It right no the main strip. Afford and the food tastes fresh. They have a lot of choices. Plus some homemade breads and rolls. I had 3 eggs perfectly cooked over medium 2 fluffy pancakes shredded crispy potatoes and bacon. I was full and happy at the end.Dine in: Yes
Takeout: Yes",

"We were on our way to another breakfast place when we passed The Stables and saw the full parking lot and figured it must be good. It was great! Friendly service, great food and reasonable prices and decent restroom.",
A wonderful place to eat. Breakfastis an all time favorite. Food like you would expect at home.,
"Got in before it was particularly busy Sunday morning, plenty of staff, grabbed a table, and the server gave me coffee. I asked for a minute to look at the menu, and no one ever came back to take my order. I gave up after 15-20 minutes. Adding one star because they didn't charge me for the ""bottomless"" coffee (though since I didn't see the server again so I only got the first cup).",

"Service and food:
Stables is a local hot spot. They are one of the earliest places to open and have decent prices. The food Is good and the service is above average especially given how busy they always are.
The place is also always clean. They wipe the tables after each use and the bathrooms are clean every time I've used them.

Covid updates to the restaurant:
They have sneeze guards put up in between the booths ( on the backs of the booth seats to divide each booth from the next) for added protection which is appreciated. Its way more than the chain restaurants are doing to ease worries nearby.Dine in: Yes
Takeout: Yes
Delivery: No",

ALWAYS a great Omlette! AND LOVE their HOMEMADE bread.,
"Being a local, we visit quite often.  Food is always good and we like the daily specials.",
Classic diner breakfast that'll fill you up for the next few days. Service is quick but there might be a wait. Highly recommended.,
This diner was awesome! The Food Was phenomenal! I got the breakfast and you get alot! My friend got breakfast and pancakes too. He couldn't finish them they were so huge. My Son got a Fried chicken sandwich with fries. It was good but the patty was a little small. The Staff was very pleasant and efficient. üíóüíóüíóüíéüåüüòÅ,
"Hands down the best breakfast in western mass, even better than mimos in west Springfield",
The food was fabulous. Looked good for seeing it. Tasted even better eating it. I have always been a fan of home cooked restaurants. I have become big on taste and flavors. They definitely exceeded my expectations. I will be back gor more.,
First time! Service was very good and waitress' were also! Food above average with healthy portions. Didn't really like the quality of their sausages but pancakes were excellent... Out of lemons???,
"I'm going to tell you right off the rip that the one star that's missing here is for the driveway. I'm pretty sure that there have been more than one broken axle in the train wreck that they call a parking lot. However if you drive a truck, a Jeep, or a tank, I highly recommend going and eating here.

The food was all cooked extremely well. They were a little slow on the coffee refills, but not so much that you had to start waving anyone down. I had the Irish benedict, and the hash was extremely good. The cornbread made such a wonderful difference for this meal. I would eat that daily.

The pricing was fair, and I found it to be accurately priced for the level of food in the quality of ingredients that was served.

I would definitely go again, if I was in the area. As long as we were in our jeep, and not my sedan. Because I got to be honest, that was a little scary in the Subaru.",

"The BEST biscuits and gravy. Everything made-to-order. Can get very crowded, so get there early for breakfast.",
"Always a good place to go for a full plate of food. Quality is usually on par, but as with home cooking there are those times and I understand.
But raw hashbrowns?
I just went order them again.",
Service was great. Prices are great so make sure and tip. And the food was amazing. Will be coming back.,
Best breakfast in Hadley! Any time I visit Hadley I make sure to stop in for breakfast at The Stables! The food is always amazing. The staff is very friendly. The restaurant is kept clean! I highly recommend stopping in to grab a bite!,
"Good prices, quick service, clean. If you're getting home fries ask to get them well done, changes the game. The Starving College Boy meal is legit. Got the option for canned or homemade corned beef hash. You need an off-road vehicle to make it through the parking lot but other than that this place is a jewel.",
Cute little place. Corned beef hash seemed home-made and was really good. My husband had the eggs Benedict he really enjoyed it. The staff was friendly and quick. I highly recommend,
"Yummy, quite cheap breakfast. Some mildly healthy options though most of it is not. Their pancake is great. I like that you can ask to get just one or two instead of a stack of three which is totally ginormous. Plus you can ask them to mix toppings. Service is always good. I like the Florentine eggs as well.",
"I had breakfast here with my family. We got there about 9:30. We were seated right away and our server came right away. She was friendly and attentive. Coffee was served within a couple of minutes. The menu had a lot of great choices and breakfast was delivered quickly. The seating is set up so you dont feel crowded. We were pleased with the food, service, and the price. I highly recommend you give this place a visit. If this was helpful, please give me a thumbs up. Thanks, and have fun!",

"Never had anything bad there, more importantly my wife has never had anything bad there. Very good omelettes, very good breakfast. Reasonably priced. Lunch portions are usually more than you can eat. The staff is very nice, and the food comes out quickly. Can be very busy on the weekends, but we never had to wait long to be seated.",
Great New England style breakfast in a classic NE setting,
Very good! I had the corned beef hash and it was delicious made fresh and not from a can. Everything else was well prepared as well. Prices were very fair and portions were generous. Definitely a return trip is in order to try out more of their offerings.,
"The food tasted good while I was there, but boy oh boy did I leave with a stomach ache",
"Very good breakfast! I had the blueberry pancakes!! First off, they are PANCAKES! Second, they were really good. I'll definitely get them again at some point. Look forward to the next visit.",
Great breakfast place. We ordered steak and eggs which was just ok and the three berry French toast which was incredible!! Will definitely return and recommend.,
"We live in northern Connecticut but make it up to Western mass at least a couple of times a month. Stables is our favorite restaurant for breakfast. Not only is the food great but it is more reasonably priced than some other restaurants in the Northampton area
Today we drove into the parking lot at quarter of 2 and I knew that the restaurant closed at 2:00 p.m.  I was worried that we were too late for breakfast but the waitress graciously seated us and took our order.  Even though they were about to close the doors we were not rushed at any time and enjoyed eating our breakfast at a normal leisurely pace.
They have taken all the appropriate Covid 19 precautions including plexiglass dividers,  Rigorous table and bathroom cleaning and even a contact list that you sign so that customers can be traced should a positive case of Covid 19 be discovered.
Everything that we ordered was great. The bacon was just right - thick and crispy, the sausage was cooked perfectly as well.
We had a generous portion of home fries and ended up having to leave some on the plate as we got so full. Our waitress checked on us often to see how the food was and to refill our coffee.
Believe it or not the most favorite part of the meal for us is the homemade oatmeal molasses toast. We ended up buying a loaf  as well to bring home so we can have fond memories of our visit today.
As you know, with the pandemic and all the associated economic issues that we're Experiencing, many independent restaurants are in danger of closing. I would encourage you to support the Stables and other small local businesses as well.",
"Best corned beef hash, by far! Seriously, you'll never have better. Good coffee, omelets cooked perfectly, and crispy bacon, just how you like it. Our server Tess was great, and all the other staff we interacted with were so friendly and welcoming. It's a cute little place and we can't wait to come back.",

"Food is always tasty.  The eggs duchess are a go- to favorite,  I've also enjoyed their challah French toast and this week had a delicious Monte Cristo sandwich.  I judge a breakfast place by its home fries and these receive good marks..",
"We got take out about a month ago, order was wrong...i spoke with the server and she said they would take care of it next time,mistakes happen. Food itself is OK,it seems like it used to be a little better (like 5+ years ago).

Here's the thing,though-since they now have outdoor seating (only) we decided to go one AM recently - it wasn't that busy but both of the servers completely ignored us so we left...sorry,that's not how you run any biz.",

Great breakfast for a good price. The staff was friendly and service was quick. I was full and happy after enjoying my meal outside. Would definitely come back to explore the menu.,
Amazing diner and dinner style food. Worth the watch cuz they got such a big menu. We go back often for amazing customer service and delicious grub for gatherings.,
"The homemade hash is amazing! Overall this is a great spot to eat! Great food with equally great service. Don't drive past this diner , it's a must stop!",
"Don't believe them when they claim lousy coffee, bad food, and poor service. This place offers some of the best breakfast and lunch options in the area with wonderful variety, reasonable prices, amazing specials, and servers who go the extra mile.",
Friendly service! Great food! I'll be back!,
Excellent food awsome staff highly recommended love this place,
I've been to Stable's twice in the past few months and both times were very nice. The picnic tables that they have set up outside are very convenient for those who are uncomfortable eating inside. I have tried both the eggs benedict and the French toast and I would probably order either of them again.,
Savory and sweet old fashioned cooking. Haven't had biscuits and gravy that good since being down South! Only down side if you are in a hurry not ideal because you have to wait for that home cooking!,
"Recently I stopped in and ordered corn chowder and chicken pie, 2 favorite foods.  The corn chowder was passable because it had a lot of items in it( including unannounced chicken). It could have been more flavorful. The chicken pie was just chick and some veggies in a thick, flavorless white sauce with 4 small squares of pastry on top. Pumpkin pie and coffee good.",

"Stables serves delicious breakfast and lunch foods. Staff is efficient and friendly. The pricing is also reasonable. Their hot cider is wonderful, especially on a chilly New England morning. Only downside is the building is small so if you come at a busy time, you'll be waiting. Amusingly enough, the parking lot can hold probably twice what can be seated. Definitely worth swinging by if you're in the Amherst area.",
null,

"Horrible is all I can say.  Food was terrible, place was packed, followed direction to wait in line only to be told we can start ourselves at the counter. Last two times we have been here have been like this, not worth the trip or the money.",
"Best breakfast in Hadley, everywhere else can eat their hearts out.

Seriously though, the place is cheap, the staff is friendly, the food is good, and there's tons of parking. I've never waited for a seat and my food comes real fast. It isn't bland it seems pretty high quality. Everything is great here.

Pros:
- Fast, cheap, good
- Friendly staff
- Never waited for a seat
- Lots of parking
- Open early

Cons:
- Not open all day or night",

Great food. Very friendly staff.,
"Food is ok, they changed their hash and didn‚Äôt bother letting us know so we were surprised by what was supposed to look like hash..and not to mention the customer service is awkward. There‚Äôs always a blonde waitress with a rude attitude. And by the way, to go orders should ALWAYS have utensils and such. Not that hard.",
Always come here for breakfast when I'm in town.,
Will never go there again. At the beginning the waitress seem to be nice and checking up on me and my family. I‚Äôm eating and she comes with the check like if I was ready to leave. If your Hispanic this not the place to go.,
"Wonderful food,  great prices and staff, can't wait to go back.",
Usually always get a good breakfast and breakfast specials here... but if you come during the week you can also find great lunch specials.  Terrific Coffee and typically fast service.,
Great small town restaurant.  Awesome breakfast friendly service. Food was delicious üíØ,
"Came here with my boyfriend this morning for some ‚Äúcountry cooking‚Äù and it was more like convict cooking. I can make better breakfast. The grits were dry, all the food tasted like it had been sitting at a buffet. The home fries were wet and soggy, and they threw 2 slices of American cheese over top of my sunny side up eggs...? Charged 1.95 for a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù orange juice when the cup was very small. $30 in breakfast not worth it. Awful cooking",

"I actually worked at Stables for three years starting as a dishwasher and worked as a prep/line cook. I can assure that it‚Äôs 100% homemade food because we prep everything; hashbrowns, bread, pancake/French toast batter, bacon, muffins etc. My man Steve behind the grill is a master and Al, who is the main prep cook, is extremely overqualified (working as a cook in Japan for 13 years).  The owner Bret is very friendly and the wait staff are all sweethearts. I can also assure you that the kitchen is kept clean due to the diligence that goes into it. I just wish that they made the waiting area bigger cause it‚Äôs easy to tell that people get frustrated with the situation. Overall great restaurant. If your not close by try out the other location in Palmer.",

The service was quick and great, the food was even better and the atmosphere was comfortable and cozy! If I could give 10 stars I would!",
Nice small local restaurant. I've been coming here since I was very little they've always been Friendly and the Foods been good. My one comment about this place would it be that sometimes it gets very packed and can be hard to get a seat as it's not that big of a restaurant.,
Best breakfast around at any price. Consistently good food served by long standing wait staff that aims to please. Been coming for years and never disappoints.,
Breakfast is just as good now as it was back then when I use to visit friends at UMass. Got here around 9ish on a Saturday and it was packed so be ready to wait in line. Regulars were served a little more favorably from what I saw but I don't personally care since I got my food in a timely manner and had my water/coffee refilled when needed.,

Homemade fresh food and pastries.  Busy on weekends due to the good food and friendly atmosphere.  This place is family owned and has been popular since at least the 70's.  The corned beef hash and homemade bread is delicious.,

Very friendly staff.  Small place. Food was very average. Had a special omlette and biscuits and gravy.  Not a bad place though.  I would recommend.,
"Breakfast Food was good. The interior needs some work. Two of the counter seats are badly ripped, the place looks worn. I requested lemon and honey for my tea and was told the owner now charges .95 for each honey packet which I think is a a rip off to the patrons. There are many fine restrauants in hadley that do not nickle and dime customers.",

"I like the food, but I am giving it one star because I've repeatedly received AWFUL service from this one waitress. She checked up on everyone else's table, but mine, and I finally got a refill of coffee, silverware, and my order of food from another waitress after seeing she was being negligent to me. Im polite, yet she acted like it was a bother serving me, and was very rude. I wished I had gotten other waitresses, although after the number of times of bad service, I realize it's not worth the gamble!! I will be going elsewhere for breakfast now.",

"Had lunch here on my last trip out to Hadley. Had the Stables Melt -- ham, cheese and egg on a bulkie roll -- that really hit the spot. Small wait for lunch, but food came out quick and waitress was pleasant and attentive with coffee and soda refills. I'd certainly stop here again for a quick bite -- nice place!",
My husband and I stopped for breakfast. We sat at the counter. It has great food at a reasonable price. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff as well. We will definitely be back.,
I go here whenever I want great service good diner food and financially reasonable prices. They always make up most beautiful corned beef hash but I'm the kind of guy who just wants to hash from the can Hormel Style.,
Delicious u can't beat it very tasty üëçüå∑üëç,
Great diner fare! The service was great and speedy. The home fries are delicious...a definite must try!,
"Excellent breakfast in a neatly decorated place and not too expensive. One of the waitresses we had was neither very friendly nor competent, the other waitress, however, was both.",
Yum. That's all I must say. They got yummy eggs. Better then blue bonnet.,
"I visited July 29th 2019, the food was great, as always. However the new waitresses certainly leave a lot to be desired, unfriendly and not very nice. What happened to the previous great crew???",
We have been coming here for many years. Food is always good and mirrors home cooking. We ate outside and the service was excellent.,
Food was great if you could get the terrible wait staff to get your order right! It would have been a better experience if the waitress didn't show she hated her job and self so much.,
"Excellent.  Wonderful home- made food.  There is nothing bad I could say about this restaurant.  Great service and food, especially the breakfast",
"Left after not even being acknowledged... I'm always happy to wait for a table or service, greeting a customer takes a second though and makes a customer feel welcome even if your busy and can't help immediately.",
Service was excellent food was excellent. Hope to come back one time before we can go back to Washington State,
I called to order breakfast and the employee asked me to hold for a minute.  Employee set the phone down and forgot she even answer the phone!!  I could hear her in the background talking for about 5 minutes so I hung up and called back.  now the line is busy.... I guess I‚Äôm still on hold.  SMH,
"Great service and tasty food! Although the space is small, they have always been very accommodating of large groups I've been with when eating there.",
If you haven't gone here for breakfast your missing out on some great food. The homemade hash is the best. Always good specials and the coffee is great.,
Amazing food!  Loved it!  Down home feeling.,
Not impressed the food was disappointing paid almost $18 for just 3 eggs if you make the strips and two toes how do you justify that,
Great place for breakfast.  Good food and a good portion.  We wished we would have found it sooner.,
Despite their famous slogan... The food here is always good and the service is great! Definitely my favorite spot for breakfast/diner food in the area,
