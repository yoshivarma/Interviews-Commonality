"Wow , I can not thank the ER staff enough tonight.
My daughter came in with extreme cough high fever and vomit , we were expecting a long wait but they got to us as fast as they could, every single one of them spoke softly and kindly to my daughter , explaining everything they were doing. She even got stickers and a teddy bear. The chest X-ray was amazing , only because they took the time to show her the machine and pictures . I really can express how reliving it is to have people that really accommodate all ages in the ER . We came in scared but left with smiles and relief on our faces.
Thank you !"
My son brought me to the Cooley Dickinson ER this April for a TIA/ mini stroke...blood clot in my brain. I have to say that the Medical Staff was Excellent! They called a Code and I was placed on a gurney and whisked away for Every test imaginable and the people explained Everything to me in a very calm + clear manner. I was admitted to  Cardiac/Telemetry for 3 days and the Nurses and the CIA'S were absolutely Wonderful! I can't say enough about my Stay at Cooley Dickinson! I wouldn't go to Any Other Hospital if I needed Emergency Medical Care!! I was treated like Family and the Nurses and Everyone Else were So Attentive and Kind. They All made my stay there as Pleasant and Comfortable as could be and I'm so grateful for all they did ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you All for your Awesome care!
"Honestly you guys just suck. Your staff is rude and sometimes abusive. You're x-ray crew is chill but everything else is not good. I've never had a great visit with you and will never recommend someone go to you.
Also your partnered health centers are sad. The doctors and nurses there are good, but I usually get more sick going there then better.
Also when you say you're open till a certain time for things like blood work, you shouldn't stop taking people 15 min early unless you're busy. If you're waiting room is empty there's no excuse. Blood work takes 5 min.
As soon as my insurance changes I will be going elsewhere other than Cooley."

"Last July I was directed to come here for issues with my asthma. I had my vitals checked then waited several hours without being seen at all. When I was finally seen I was given apbuterol and a chest X-ray the. Sent on my way. After months I received a bill after no contact with the hospital and already paying a $220 doctor fee telling me I owed more money. The bill listed my visit as a level 4 visit a problem that requires urgent attention and care, despite my several hour wait and the low level of care I received. When I called to ask about it after a week I was informed it was level 4 because they took more than 3 vitals, ousting respiration, blood pressure and height and weight. Incredibly poor guy experience and they are running a scam in their billing department. Highly recommend seeking care elsewhere."

Yesterday I went for a CT scan and it was my first time I was super nervous and not ready for the exam! When I got there I was greeted by the most wonderful nurse named Carla. She explained the procedure multiple times to me and knew I was nervous and constantly checked up on me during the prep! She took the time to talk to me and make sure I was ok! She also on top of everything made sure she was in the room with me during the scan upon approval of the doctor. As I was being injected she held my hand and told me it was going to be ok in addition to telling me exactly what was happening when it was happening! I can not thank Carla enough for her exceptional kindness! She really goes out of her way for all her patients and is seriously the most caring nurse I ever met I wish I could thank her more then this I truly wish! Thank you Carla!

"I went today to pick up X-rays that were done several months ago. I had called last week to order them. They were ready on arrival, kind staff with a cheery disposition served me. Parking near the x-ray library entrance was easy."
"One of the worst hospitals I‚Äôve ever worked at. Along with the racism , I was a diversity hire. The nurses are all miserable and cliquey. The staff treats the sides like trash and the aides , treat eachother poorly. They joke about patients that pass away . Nothing but ugliness inside this hospital. Stay away if you‚Äôre a person of color! Please!"

"I was scolded by a nurse, and then assaulted by her . We had a terrible experience with the ED department nurses. They were caddy and so unprofessional. Escalating a situation that requires de escalation . The nurse was taking my questions personally, became upset , and started threatening to section.. they were /are uncaring, and dishonest. Completely unhelpful. Would NEVER go here again . They are not adequately trained in dealing with crisis . Place is filthy , and I would recommend almost anywhere else ."

"I got second hand embarrassment of how inappropriate and awful the staff acted towards each other and towards patients. Yikes. If they put half as much effort into bettering their entry level skills as they did bullying everyone, they may be worth two stars."
"My wife just came out from getting a blood test in tears. At first I thought she was in pain. Instead, she told me the woman who took her blood was incredibly rude and had yelled at her publicly and didn‚Äôt let up."
If you want to be in an environment where discrimination is actively used toward the Muslim commmunity then this is the place for you. A woman was jumped by 3 STAFF member because she was wearing a hijab. This harsh environment is extremely scary and not acceptable.
This hospital did not notify me till my mom was about to passaway  so I couldn't be with her when I got their they claim they tryied everything' but already had her unhooked  with empty medication in every IV bag. before I could say good bye to my mother or be with her when they knew for hours my mom wasn't doing good supposedly. The stay was unpleasant. They sure did claim my mother as a covid death even tho she didn't die of that  üí∞. Do not trust your loved ones at any of these hospitals.they  are more about the money then the health of the patient.
"I'm quite surprised by the polarizing reviews here that swing between 1 and 5 with almost no other rating in between. Honestly I have always had very positive experience with the hospital and particularly the ER department. The admission was quick with no hassle, and the doctors and nurses were really friendly and knowledgeable. Surely they don't have as many specialists as bigger hospitals, but they are excellent for routine and uncomplicated procedures. Being part of the patient gateway system is also a big plus -- test results are accessible online as soon as they are done, it's super convenient for me."

"Called looking for my mom, who had been a patient and I had been able to speak to her the other week, they couldn‚Äôt find her, was accused of ‚Äúcold calling‚Äù hospitals."
"New Years Eve I was taken to Cooley by ambulance. I had ruptured a blood vessel in my foot. The staff was reluctant to help and did as little as possible. They released me and before I left the ER my wound starting bleeding again. They let me back into the ER. My wife was the only one working to stop the bleeding. They were reluctant to do anything. We finally got them involved after screaming for help. They corterized the vein.
I don't recommend Cooley if you are in need of attention."

"I worked at Cooley for nearly 10 years, initially, it was a wonderful place to work. I am a patient here as well. A few years ago I had given a 5 star review, but it has changed greatly. I personally believe that the choice to merge with MGH is potentially a factor in this as I watched this go from a well rounded community hospital to being run by people from Boston who haven't a clue or (seemingly) care about that community. CDH and MGH built new offices and remodeled some previously existing sites to be a ""one stop shop"" type facility...with no regard at all to how that effected your staff. The idea of having a building house more resources in one place was great, but the greed aspect of it all really shined through with how the set up was created for staff. You forced staff into ""cross training"" by doing this set up, which caused most of your staff to partially learn multiple departments, take on unrealistic work loads with an extremely time consuming EMR, and spread themselves so thin with all the juggling and clicking that they cannot even give quality care anymore.You send staff from one location to another, rotate them through job roles, and instead of having staff do one department exceptionally well anymore, you have staff doing subpar at multiple departments. It shows everywhere you go that this model isn't working. The amazing staff here want to provide consistent quality care to their community but do not have the opportunities anymore to do so. CDH is lacking in competitive pay rates verse other places of work, the workloads feel unhealthy, and it lacks ladders for internal staff to climb for growth opportunities within. There isn't incentive or appeal to stay here long term and likely you will burn out with the way you are shuffled around, working for multiple offices and multiple specialties (aka they hired you for a specific department but you'll end up cross training so they got you learning/working multiple jobs really for the pay of one üôÑ). It has gotten lost on CDH that staff aren't interchangeable just because the job title is the same or they click similar buttons - each office has their own terminology/policies/schedules/forms/do's/don'ts/copays/and many many other nuances to learn and the expectation for someone to juggle all of that has resulted in the partially learning and subpar patient care they give now. From a patient perspective I feel the quality of care has gone down but still decent in comparison to my experiences at Baystate or Holyoke Medical. My PCP spends time with me and I feel heard - Other departments are clearly struggling to keep their heads above water and often don't respond in a timely manner when referred. Likely because they are severely understaffed and the amount of rescheduling occurring at CDH is absolutely out of control. And no, its not really due to the pandemic, it's not really due to staff being out or equipment down, it is usually more often because they continue to take on new patients when they lack the bandwidth and access to do so without taking established patients and bumping out their appointments to make room for the new patients or simply staff have been told someone else needs the appointment and matter more than you so you are getting moved (which, is true some people do matter more but if you had the appropriate amount of staff to begin with and limited the number of patients your practice took on you wouldn't have an access issue to begin with). I hope CDH can get back to its roots and opt for quality of care before quantity of patients just for the sake of $$$. The medical workers here have always been some of the most caring healthcare workers I've ever crossed paths with and are doing their best given all of the circumstances. I hope things change for the better for staff sake and for the patients in this community."

Wasted lives and resources. Numerous inexperienced doctors and nurses and major mistakes from medication and surgery and records department and major Hippa violations in all departments. Unsanitary conditions from beds....bathrooms surgical instruments. Misdiagnosed patients leading to injury and even death. Stay away. What a shame to the patients üòï üòû and community üòï üòû üòî üò¢

"I arrived at 5am scared, having sharp chest pains and shallow breathing.  A chest x ray ruled out another pneumothorax.  At 6:50am the doctor said she'd be back to so some ultrasound pics of my heart.   It is now 2:30pm.   No sign of Dr.  I have NEVER felt so uncomfortable and forgotten.   I understand that they are overwhelmed, but this is crazy.  Leaving someone in pain, alone, scared having trouble breathing for 8 hours????   I had to hit the code blue button to get someone's attention.  I asked for my discharge papers and had friends come pick me up.  I am the easiest patient usually."

"Had a perfect experience giving birth in this hospital. The nurses were angels, especially Felicia! They followed my birth wish/plan completely. The staff made sure to give me the freedom and very minimal intervention while laboring. We were given rest and peace after delivery and nobody came in to bug the baby or us. Also, all of the testing was done in the room so we never had to give our baby away. Amazing.

P.S. we stayed in a room with a queen bed which made such a big difference because my husband was able to sleep with me and cuddle with us most of the time!"

"Absolutely THE WORST E.R. EVER.  Long waits made worse by zero compassion. After 4 hours sitting (which was unbearable)...we begged for a gurney....we were sent home with an injection for pain, and pain meds and no imaging ordered for severe, immobilizing back pain. After leaving, In desperation,  we called to a chiropractor across the street who fit us in right away,  made the patient comfortable, supplied a back brace, cold packs, crutches and ordered imaging.. at Baystate Radiology. Cooley Dickinson..? NEVER AGAIN."

"My PCP left the practice in February '21, they (Cooley-Dickinson) said they would set me up with a new PCP, it is October '21 and I still have no PCP. Cannot get into contact with a human that will give me a call back; also no way to even e-mail. I need my immunization records so I can go back to college!!! Sick and tired of waiting and shameful that I need to post an accurate review to ""hopefully"" get help."
"I give CDHospital a 3.75 star rating. Just back from a routine colonoscopy procedure. I had one ten years ago at the same place, and IMO my experience then was more positive than today's. The prepping was easy this time around (like 10 yrs ago), the nurses responsive before the procedure. However, only one out of three of the attending nurses actually treated me like a human, and not a robot. I believe her name was Sally, but can't remember...she was respectful and caring. The two doctors were fine, not exceptionally caring, but fine and proficient. Call me old, but I want to have a 5 star experience including all nurses and doctors! After the procedure, I was a bit 'out of it', and did not ask about follow up diet, which I forgot to ask about. I remember ten years ago they gave me a handout on what to eat and not eat, 24 hrs after the colonoscopy. That would have been helpful to have as I left the hospital. That lack of paperwork, and only one caring nurse out of three, leaves me with a 3.75 star rating. **Cooley Dickinson, I know you can do better!**"
"I went to the lab, which reports to all the Cooley network doctors and accesses their orders online. The techs are professional and friendly. The hospital location is the only one in the area open on Saturday mornings, which is a great help if you have a Monday doctor's appointment and forgot you needed a blood draw until after 5 on Friday."

"THE WORST EXPERIENCE!! My sister went there on Saturday morning, the 12 of June, the nurse that took care of her, named Amy was EXTREMELY RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL!! My sister was on room 12C, and had a man nurse who had no empathy at all for my sister, then Amy took over being even worst!!
They should know that NOBODY goes to ER for fun and most definitely to be treated the way my sister was treated.
CDH needs to be more careful when you hire your employees."

"Honestly looking at the reviews I'm in disbelief. I gave birth 2 times at cooley and they were the most positive happy experiences ever. Nurses are amazing and caring, midwives are awesome. One in particular I gave birth with last, Elise Thomson. Best midwife ever. I couldn't have asked for a better one. She let me have exactly the ""home birth"" I was envisioning. I had only good experiences with the birth center. Thankyou cooley Dickinson for caring for the mamas and babies‚ù§"

"If I could give 6 stars, I would. Recently went in for a colorectal surgery performed by Michelle W Helms MD. From the moment I arrived I was tended to promptly and treated with genuine kindness. The insertion of my IV was painless (and boy, I hate needles) and every staff member I encountered treated me with like I was a member of their family. I can honestly say I have never had such wonderful care. The post operative nurses were prompt and attentive and just so nice. I cannot say enough about this well run hospital at the North building. Michelle Helms has an incredible bedside manner. It is no wonder she has so many high reviews."

"To start this whole thing off. I have to tell you, there is a fantastic cast of characters that took care of me while I voluntarily admitted. I did so due to my increased risk to myself. It was one of the most anxiety plagued moments of my life. No one ever wants to ask for help. I was panicking as I walked through the emergency room door. I felt ashamed that I was going there for help.

I had no reason to be. As I learned through my experience in the ED. The nurse gave me a new set of clothes and a new mask. They took inventory of my stuff and placed it in a secure area until I was ready to be moved. The nurse that was tending to me was very kind and understanding as she took my vitals and asked a few 'get to know ya' questions. I was moved to this pod like room. A safe pod with a bed, TV, chalk board, and some paper. After talking with crisis and a few nurses, I was admitted. Without me even mentioning anything, I was brought a meal and was offered water and help. The pod door wasn't locked but it was in a safe area of the hospital, more sound proof than you'd think, I couldn't hear anything outside the room.

Next day comes. They inform me I'm moving up to 5West upstairs. I can't remember his name, I believe it was Khunga. He was a very nice man with a very gentle and easy going manner introduced himself and really made me feel at ease (still in crisis at this point, but the act of kindness was just settling, ya know.) He spoke slowly and easily, while at the same time showing worry for me as I was going through this process. He assured me I was safe and in good hands.

So they set me up in , a two person room with one bed each. One chair. Two pillows and access to extra blankets if needed. They also had quite a bit of storage for clothes and other belongings. The roommate I had, they must have mapped out my whole personality beforehand and found the best roommate fit. He was awesome. The floor allows you too roam freely, access to snacks, drinks, and other amenities within reason. They will lock it up if they notice any excessiveness. All you have to do is ask for someone to let you in. (Absolutely reasonable) They also had an activity room,¬† access to groups, skills classes, breathing and mediation, laundry was provided or if you want to do your own. (They offer pods.)

When I say groups, I mean literal self help groups in a group setting) They are informative, filled with adapting skills, coping with negative thoughts, how to deal with anger and negative thoughts to name a few. They run¬† Usually 45min a class. They provide a wide variety of options for exercises including Tai Chi, Tapping, reading, drawing, access to television in common areas, etc. The counselors offer an ear if you need it. Will make suggestions when you ask and help when needed. They have an organized schedule for the day.

I believe my stay truly taught me some coping strategies, a new outlook, and goals such as being in CONSTANT PURSUIT (as Jim says) . Always be in constant pursuit of happiness, bettering yourself, or just about any other positive thing in your life. The only thing I have to say. In order for this to work, you have to want to help yourself, as with any recovery. Strive to be better.

The only reason I'm about to list names is because I find them to be amazing people. True everyday heroes. Jim, Jordan, Joe, Chloe, Beth, Dr Durie, Matthew, Kristie, Chris, Jaime, Dmitri, and all the staff that have names I can't remember.¬†No disrespect intended. This includes a shoutout to janitorial for keeping that place as sanitary and clean as they do. I swear that I woke up every morning thinking they buffed the floors (because they were very shiny, not because of any noise . I slept well)

I was in and out in a week feeling better with a diagnosis of what disorder I have and how to combat it. I did not feel rushed at all. I felt safe, cared for, understood. I recommend you get any help with your needs but if you're in the strange market of ""shopping for hospitals,"" Shop here! The staff is incredible and smart. You can really succeed!"

"I had one of the worst days of my life thanks to this pathetic hospital. I was referred to them for an urgent ultrasound, and they denied me care despite my presenting the urgent order from my doctor and then having them directly fax it over. Once this happened, the women at registration changed their story, saying they needed a call, and were very rude and condescending to me overall. I was making phone calls with scheduling and waiting for them to supposedly get back to me for SIX HOURS. Everyone I spoke to could tell I was near hysterical, but there was no sympathy offered. My mom and I finally gave up, starving and in tears, with no offer to schedule me later.

Also, I have come here multiple times for anaphylaxis and received mediocre care every time. The doctors only show up hours later and don't keep me overnight, which they should really do for anyone with anaphylaxis. Next time my life is on the line, I'll make the ambulance go 20 minutes farther to Bay State because I am beyond disappointed this place."

"I arrived at the ED Easter morning & was attended to by friendly, professional, caring staff. I was admitted that day. I arrived at the Cardiac Telemetry Unit worried about what was coming next. I was greeted by an amazing staff!
Nurses: Conor, Sharon, Jennifer, Charleen, & Danielle
PCAs: Erin, Gina & Megan
Student Nurse from U Mass: Spencer & a few others as well as their teacher
Dietary: Kayla
PT: Carl & OT
Cardiology: Dr. Obasare & Emily
Environmental Services: Carmen
Imaging Department
Blood lab
Transport
Dietary that delivered my meals
Response teams
If I forgot anyone, I‚Äôm sorry.

Obviously working mainly with the Nurses & PCAs assigned to me but also the unit as a whole were great. All of these people were outstanding & crucial to my stay, making me feel safe as well as helping me get on the right road to becoming healthier. I can‚Äôt say enough for their kindness, great attitudes, & the way they swiftly accommodated all my needs. If I rang the call bell it didn‚Äôt seem to matter who was assigned, the closest person would be in to help me with a smile, regardless of what was needed. Just knowing they were on the unit soothed any anxiety I may have had for whatever reason. I can‚Äôt express what an asset these people/unit is to the hospital. I just want to thank them for everything they did for me & the way they all handled themselves during any process.

Separately & NOT taking anything from the others I would give hospitalist Dr.Kielbasa 1star. Lacking any bedside manner, spending as little time as possible with me & not giving me results from important tests I had. In my opinion she does not fit in with this incredible unit."

"I recently visited this hospital. The staff were friendly staff but I was hit by a massive cost after my colonoscopy. This was never disclosed to me by the hospital and it tainted my whole experience. Just be aware before your treatment to check what the hospital costs before you get a BIG surprise down the track. Sorry guys, I was really hoping to rate you a lot higher but I feel a little scammed!"

"Laurie Lestyna is a rude, horrible, disrespectful person who does not understand lactation. Get rid of her, she is incredibly ignorant."
"Everyone here is cold-blooded, they cannot feel what you feel. When you came here by an ambulance, no one was waiting outside to arrange what room you should go. After several minutes, ambulance staff randomly put me into a dirty room. At first, no doctors or nurses came into my room to ask me questions or give me some pain relief medicine, after 30 minutes, one old lady eventually came into my room. I begged her in order to have some pain relief medicines, she said she will get them. But the second time she came back is another 30 minutes. During this time, my pain level is always 10(from 0 to 10). They gave me a cup and let me drink all of the liquid. I didn‚Äôt know what that is, neither the nurse did.

I know nothing about the surgery, but the experience after the surgery is not good, either. One nurse was always smiling to you, no matter how terrible situation you have. She even sang songs when she gave you the plain relief medicine."
"For the past few years I have been getting sent to Bay State hospital after I had a seizure because ""Cooley doesn't do head trauma."" On May 23rd of this year I fractured my tibula and Cooley only sent me to Cat scan then sent me to Bay State hospital where I waited 3 DAYS to have surgery. This hospital really needs to upgrade their patient care instead of transferring the patient's elsewhere. Oh and that so called telephone ""survey"" I left a negative review and here is my final one. I was born at this hospital not at Bay State!"

Waited for 8 hours to get seen but everyone I talked to was pretty nice and wanted to help
"I waited 3 hours after a fall. I in fact had a severe concussions. This is not the 1st time Cooley ER has been extremely negligent. I was brought by ambulance to ER after a severe fall to the back of my head. Ii got there they told me they see me in a few hours when I sobered up. I hadn't drank or done ANY drugs.... My words were coming out wrong as I  was confused from fall on my head! I begged them to test me even the police who called ambulance told them I'd had a severe fall while walking my dog , I fell flat back on my head onto ice chunks. I don't know much from there blurry.  I walked out of hospital confused. My family was looking for me. I was wandering the streets unaware and a friend found me. I refused to go back for fear they'd pre judge me. I have NO PRIOR ISSUES WITH DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. I do have PTSS and was judged my medical staff on those ground assuming I vused drugs or alcohol. I DON'T!"

"VERY professional and pleasant as the experts figured out the mystery of an array of symptoms!   Everyone was cheerful and encouraging, and what is best, they sent me home with a solution!  Thank you, Cooley!"
"This hospital is terrible care wise and afterwards. I am already on a set payment plan with them to pay off my emergency room visit, and they have sent multiple collection agencies after me in an attempt to get me to pay my costs off immediately. They also call me at least 3 times a week for the same purpose. As I said before I'm already on a payment plan with them and am paying it off and will pay it fully off eventually. I however am a junior in college and at this moment do not have the ability to pay it in full. The care during my stay was also pretty awful. The doctors were rude, the nurses did not care for me or the other people in the rooms around me. If you have the option, do not go here. Request one of the other hospitals in the area please and thank you."

"I want to like this hospital but I don't. It takes a while to get care from emergency, even if there aren't many people waiting. I went in once for getting bleach in my eye, I waited an extra 45 minutes for the doctor while waiting in a room, he touched my eye, gave me something to put in my eye, and then that was it. For 2 minutes of care it cost $200.
My grandmother really doesn't like this hospital because they don't know how to deal with the elderly or those with memory or mental impairments well. My grandma went in for gout and got put in the hospice ward. You have to ask what they are doing to get any information, and when you do ask I've gotten attitude from a number of nurses and doctors.
Their level of professionalism isn't great. I am disappointed by the lack of care versus hearing conversations that are not work-related. Like, come on. I'm coming through emergency because... it's an emergency. I give this hospital an extra star because I was born there...
Edit: we prefer bay state. It is way out of the way but worth it. If it's not an emergency you can use urgent care but they don't take a lot of insurance"

"I‚Äôm from ohio, I was staying with some friends for a couple months while I got ready for a move to Texas. I had an emergency that took me to the ER while I was there (though none of the doctors were able to help me.) The entire staff seemed aghast and judgmental that I did not have health insurance. Which is not something I would have chosen had there been another option. I applied for financial assistance because I had no job at the time and because of covid 19 I have not been able to find employment. They declined my request for assistance because they wanted me to apply for health insurance. I was not even able to apply for government assistance because I do not live in Massachusetts. They denied my financial assistance request because of this and I have no been able to speak with anyone concerning the matter."

"It was strange at first with all the changes, but I‚Äôve adjusted happily. You see, I was born in that hospital and it seemed so small for so long. The key to my satisfaction is the connection and potential integration with MGH, under the Partners affiliation. If I hadn‚Äôt see the best specialist I could, my old medical team would have likely just missed that fact that I now have Colon Cancer.

I do have so though that I had a troubling experience in the ER yesterday. They wanted to transport me to MGH for the care I needed, but my parents were ready and waiting with all my things I‚Äôd need for an extended stay (as I have 8 times now). As soon as I said that, the Nurse named Jen started ripping IV‚Äôs off me and said since I was going against their medical advice (which I was not) they needed the room and just plopped the discharge paperwork in my hand and pointed to how to get out. I was still feeling sick/nauseous, but I asked see the Nursing Manager and she said it wasn‚Äôt the first time I guess it‚Äôs happened. How many strikes do you get? I‚Äôm sure she skipped protocol and that needed to be remedied. I do hope it gets fixed, because it‚Äôs a longer drive to Baystate, but I would if anything like this happened again. Terrible experience."

"Absolutely the most pathetic staff i have ever seen, only one nurse even understood his job, god bless him. I was there for a surgery and was put in an empty wing, not across from the nurses station no no that would be thinking of the patient, i was put DOWN THE HALL from the nurses station to far away to verbally call for help for anything. The female nurse didn't give a second thought after i was put in a room. But the male nurse came to the room when i woke up, kept me company for an hour or so to help me relax and adjust, and kept checking in on me every hour or so even if i didn't call for help. He alone deserves all the credit for my wellbeing and health that night. But sadly the story doesn't end there. I had to go back the very next day about 12 hours later, because the surgery team cut an artery in my leg causing me to slowly bleed out. Got to the hospital explained my situation and how i was there for an emergency surgery for an artery in my leg that my surgeon requested. Sat in the waiting room with internal bleeding for an hour and a half while the nurse picked her teeth, fixed her hair, popped a zit, fixed her makeup. I go to the window and ask for an update three times and on the third request she looks at me rolls her eyes and says that i can go into surgery at any time, and how the team has been waiting for 45 minutes for me to arrive. I asked why she didn't tell me this sooner and she gave a big sigh and said ""it's not my responsibility to answer questions you don't ask"" and then motioned for me to leave her window and shut her window and returned to her phone, she then took a full 3 minutes to finish up on her phone and let me through the door to a room, then it was 5 minutes and i was in surgery again. When i woke up i was given basic instructions of what the room had, what to do, and how to call for help by a nurse who spoke so efficiently all she needed to say was ""oh you're awake, ok we'll be checking in to see how you are"" closes the door behind her and never checks on me for the entire 11 hours I'm there."
"I went to the ER with a cut finger that needed stitches. It didn't seem like a very busy time and I was checked in and in a treatment room fairly quickly. The nurses were very friendly, quick and efficient. There was a brief wait while the PA who treated me took care of another patient, but she returned quickly, as promised, and did an excellent job of cleaning out and stitching my finger. I found the medical staff to be very good.
The ER itself seemed dirty. There were spots and streaks on the poorly washed floor and the glass in the treatment room doors looked as if it was washed with the same grungy mop as the floors, all grayish  streaks and spots. The walls and counter tops also had their share of mystery spots.
My compliments to the medical staff, but housekeeping needs far more attention than it is currently getting."
"i was there for 5 days after knee surgery. Very clean, nurses were very very goodI guess my only thing  was the food but that‚Äôs everybody‚Äôs complaint. We‚Äôre happy to give me whatever I wanted, but ..... excellent excellent nurses though and  my doctor is great! Dr. Boardman and all of his staff are excellent."
"Cooley is a wonderful community hospital. People seem to forget that that's what they are and for their limited size their service are huge to the valley and I have yet to have a bad experience here. I left Baystate about 5 years ago due to their inability to treat me as anything other than just a number. I remember the last interaction I had at Baystate was when I was meeting with my PCP at the time for an injury that occurred during work. He walked into the room an immediately in a very annoyed tone said ""I really hope I don't have to fill out any paperwork for this today."" I was shocked at his rudeness and shortness with me. Since coming to Cooley I have had nothing but warm interactions across the board with staff and physicians. Back in September I was admitted to the ER and from the moment I arrived at reception, to triage, to the nurses, phlebotomist, and physician I was treated with such empathy and compassion. The physician was informative, she was quick and efficient and did everything she could along with her staff to ensure I was comfortable. I will always go to CDH for any of my health needs and I highly recommend them to anyone in need of healthcare services who want to feel truly heard and cared for."

"I had a deep laceration on my thigh. I went in to have it looked at right after it happened. While I was checking in I started bleeding through my bandages. The guy sitting next to us put a towel on the floor under me and seemed annoyed. They then had me hop one legged and bleeding down the hallway to an exam room. The guy who had put the towel down ended up being a physician's assistant named Reid Motha and he came in to take care of me. He would barely look at or talk to my wife and I. We tried to engage him and talk to him, and tried to joke around since we were feeling relieved it wasn't as bad as we had feared. All he would say is that his shift was almost over and he was looking forward to going home. He quickly sewed my leg up and told us a nurse would be in to clean me up. The nurse never came, so he came back, wiped me down and told me I was good to go. I had extreme pain for the following week and a hard swelling under the wound and could not walk well. There were no signs of infection, but it did not seem right. I went to urgent care to have the sutures removed. They looked at it and said it had been closed improperly. As soon as they clipped the sutures the wound opened right back up. They said it should have been sewn up inside as well as outside, and that sewing it up only on the outside had created a pocket. I had to have a 'jelly hematoma' expressed, which was extremely unpleasant. Now I have to heal the wound while it is open, which is going to be a long, slow process. I wish the P.A. had been more focused on patient care rather than rushing through my treatment so he could go home. I would not choose to go to this ER again."

"Years ago, I went to Cooley Dickinson Hospital's emergency room, many times over several months clearly having multiple symptoms of being poisoned, from biological and chemical exposures, and they did nothing to determine what had happen to me. Treated me like a psychiatric patient or criminal from beginning to end. Refused to offer care. The symptoms, came on suddenly, acute exposure was so obvious and they refused to take me seriously. I now, years later, have damage to my whole body. Multi-system and multi-organ complications from being left with no treatment. I live compromised with the effects of a lack of treatment for what was clearly an acute poisoning. I am now so reactive to my environment that even low levels of exposure to everyday substances and compounds makes me continuously ill. I will never forget or forgive Cooley Dickinson Hospital for hurting me. Reckless and careless. I do not recommend going there for medical care."

"I've been to this hospital many times over the years. Sometimes for me, but mostly visiting others.

I'll start with my visit. I was in the ER. The nurses and doctors were ""working"" with another terrible service. However, cooley dickinson hospital did not seem to know what was going to happen to me. So over 24 hours later with no food and only two cups of water I left. I will say that there was a very disrespectful nurse working in the ER. She acted like she did not want to work there at all. Makes you wonder about how cooley dickinson hospital treats their employees.

My mother was also a patient of this horrible hospital. She was there being treated for severe pancreatitis. She would be there for weeks and would go home, but after less than a week she had to go back. This kept happening for months until she went to a different hospital. Months went by and while bringing my mother home for the day she went into cardiac arrest. She was brought to cooley and tried to be saved by a group of nurses, who in my opinion looked like high school interns. My sister and I were in the room while they were trying to revive her, but they could not save her and she passed away.

In the future, if I need medical care for anything I will go to Baystate instead of Cooley Dickinson.

Zero stars."

"I have a good friend who is dying.  He was taken to this hospital and transferred to I.C.U.  I was constantly amazed at the competence, and caring attitude of all the staff.    I never have seen such a wonderful group of people working together with the good of the patient.  The care of my friend was done with gentleness and a real concern for his welfare.  I was quite moved by those entrusted with his care.  Thank you all.

Pretty much the worst Emergency Room help I have ever received in my life. Was brought in by the paramedics to the ER because I was having abdomen pains (turned out to be acute appendicitis later!) and was literally kept there for 4 hours before the doctor came in. The nurse who was assigned to me clearly hated her job. My coat fell on the ground while she was asking me to sign some papers and she literally KICKED it out of the way. She then jabbed an injection into my arm multiple times to get a blood sample -- all this while I was bawling my eyes out as I thought the pain in my abdomen was going to kill me. She then smirked and told me she was going to call someone else. The other nurse was a complete sweetheart btw! When the doctor finally showed up he gave me the remote that the previous nurse had kept out of my reach and told me to push it if I was in too much pain and needed something for the pain. Literally the only reason I'm giving this 1 out of 5 is because the doctors were really sweet as were the people in post surgery care unit. That ER nurse deserves hell for all the pain she put me too. Completely unsympathetic and just a terrible person in general. The ER room really sucks here.

"I read the reviews, and they are so polarized!
Many of the negative reviews deal with the triage issue that all hospitals face:  The waiting area of any emergency room has a range of people on the spectrum from life threatening emergencies to chronic hypochondriacs.
In this particular case, the Google star rating system is producing unrealistic bias.  I suppose that if you were happy with the service your received then you get on with the rest of your life you won't complete the survey.
My own experience has been very positive, ranging from the professionalism of the nursing staff to the surgeons, but that is what I expected from this hospital.
This is not a teaching hospital, so you get the actual experienced surgeon doing  the critical parts of procedures, not an overworked sleep-deprived trainee medical practitioner.
I have not heard any horror anecdotes about this hospital, but have heard several really nasty ones about other area hospitals.  We are so fortunate to have this well-managed facility in our area.
In short, if you write a review, please be balanced, and remember that--in an emergency room waiting area--the world does not revolve about you: The busy staff are dealing with saving your neighbor's life or limb."

"I went to the Cooley Dickinson ER after being referred by Urgent Care. The ED was PACKED at nine am on a Wednesday. I was triaged by the nurse after about an hour and she was very nice and compassionate. However, though I was referred to the ER with a potentially serious problem; I was not brought back for FOUR hours. This was not just me, most of the patients had been waiting that long. People were being brought back for tests, then sent into the waiting area. Some were even sent back out in hospital gowns! To make matters worse, there was a terrible burning smell the entire time, and about two hours in, the fire alarm went off!

However, after I was finally called back, I was quickly seen. The nurse was very nice and caring and she made sure I was comfortable. The doctor was thorough and ordered tests right away.
I was transferred to the ICU and the doctor went out of his way to call in a specialist for me so that I wouldn't have to endure an ambulance ride to Boston. The ICU staff were also kind and helpful. My only complaint was the the lack of respect for sleep.. In the three days that I was there I rarely slept more than two hours at a time. Machines went off constantly and nurses often took up to 30 minutes to come and turn them off, not because they were ignoring you but because everyone's machines were and they are under staffed. Once I was transferred to the regular floor things were much quieter. The nurses and doctors and CNA's were extremely nice and made sure both I and my visitors were comfortable. My room was large with nice hard wood floors and a large couch for my visitors. I had a flat screen TV with many channels (i only got three in ICU on a fuzzy old TV). My only complaint was that I felt I was being held longer than necessary, but I guess that's better than not being held long enough. Overall, ER organization sucks ( making a patient who is sick enough to be in the ICU wait for four hours is inexcusable) but the hospital itself is great."
"I was terrified going into my visit. As a man suffering from pain in my testicle, I can't think of anything more scary! I also had no insurance at the time I went. The doc's here got me into the ER in 25 minutes and were immediately soothing and clear with what was going on; truly fantastic bedside manner from Dr. Schultz! On top of the care that I received, I had two different interns come into my room to give me insurance information, so now I'm going to be insured for the future as well :) I couldn't have had a better experience, this is what healthcare is all about."
"Amazing ER, walked right in, welcomed by many happy, smiling, concerned, engaging staff members all along the steps in my care. Can‚Äôt say enough good things about my experience. I got the care I needed in a timely manner, discharged with the appropriate scripts to heal and get back to my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. Thanks for getting me back to health!"

"I went into the hospital on Thanksgiving Night with double pneumonia and spent three weeks in the ICU.  Spent some time in a nursing hom and then had to come back.  Was not discharged until the end of January.  My experience and the care I received was absolutely top notch.  The co-ordination between the nursing staff, specialists, doctors and respiratory therapists  was incredible.  They were all on top of my condition at any given time and worked together to insure (hopefully) a good outcome.   The hospital was clean, the food was okay but the caring of the staff was fantastic.  I really felt well cared for and confident in the treatment I received.  I am almost completely recovered now and cannot thank CDH enough for their professionalism, friendliness and concern for my well being.  Way to go CDH!"

"Im here at the Cancer Center for chemo treatment. Let me tell you not only is it a looooong wait for the chemo to be made on site bit the overall experience was negative. The nurse i had seemed to be the only one on the floor until another nurse joined her a few hours later. Doctor Rockwell, my Cancer doctor is sweet and is highly recommended by Boston's Mass General. However the nurse was unfriendly, didnt communicate with me and never offered me anything. The guy next to me got to choose the chair for his treatment, a warm blanket, food and drink. Me nothing. Maybe it was me. They just didnt like me. Was a bad experience overall. I want to go back to Boston Mass General."

"The nurse we had when I went with my 2 year old was amazing.. as for the doctors not so much. Went there two days in a row. Due to high fevers(105) my son was sent away both times because he was acting perfectly fine. Something was not right with him. After the 2nd time of being told he‚Äôs fine I took him to his pediatrician.. within seconds we were told he has croup. Once the doctor came in we found out he had strep throat. Something the hospital should have caught, but decided to send him away because he was acting perfectly fine. Will never go back to volley with my children."

"After much anticipation for a surgery today. IV in changes and ready to go so had to call around to get the anesthesiologists (Brian) the information he just couldn‚Äôt fathom.
I explained repeatedly that I had several surgeries for this issue and had records being faxed to him.
He couldn‚Äôt be bothered to listen and called a NP
That I see who is useless and had not even returned any messages via phone, walk in to the office or from her personal phone in regards to today‚Äôs surgery for what I needed.

As a anesthesiologist what does one do with NO MEDICAL HISTORY? Really this is why this is not a good rated hospital.
I listened to Mr.B go from patient to patient talking down to them about how one should not smoke, and another should not do push up.
YOUR NOT A Doctor and if you have no damn clue what to do for a non diagnosis bleeding disorder THEN YOUR NOT A VERY GOOD ANESTHESIOLOGISTS.

Before emerging with General Hospital, the wait times on every thing was horrible. But can understand that, at times they have life and death situations, that needs to be taken care of first."
"I come in looking for help for my mental health and you people treat me like a prisoner instead. Have me sign something I didn‚Äôt understand, never told me I should have a third party before I sign. Bunk me in a double 10by6 room. And then only have a counselor talk to me 5 minutes each day, with 12 hours of nothing else. Thank you for setting me back on my goal to feeling like a human again 5 years. You truly know how to traumatize a patient and infringe on there human rights.

I understand that opioid abuse is a problem, but no one deserves to be treated with such disrespect. I am usually very pleased with Cooley Dickinson's level of care, but this experience left a very sour taste in my mouth.

One of the worst Hospitals ever. I have been waiting to get discharged from the hospital and without even telling me they make me wait 45 minutes and then thwy want to tell me its going to be 20 more minutes on top of that. When the charge nurse came to tell me i wasnt happy that thwy still made me wait an hour to be discharged. The staff here is also unprofessional doctors and nurses are very mean and disrespectful towards the patients and they think because thwy are doctors and nurses they can treat people any way they can and they cant. Take my advice dont come here if you dont have too not a good hospital

"This is the second time in the past year I have been to this hospital complaining of Chest pains, Both times i was brushed off. The first time they handed me a script of valiums and told me it was anxiety, yet the pain lasted form the minute i woke up until the minute i went to sleep. The second time, I'm pretty sure I had some type of infection in my lungs, and they performed an EKG without giving me the results and sent me back into the waiting area, At this point, I decided after 2 hours of waiting and noticing very little people being called; to leave. Your better off driving to Boston. This hospital is terrible. Throughout the EKG process the nurse pulled my shirt up, in front of other; due to the fact that the (Curtain does not close) SO the waiting rooms clear glass windows allow all the waiting patients to see in this room. I was not wearing a bra, therefore i was exposed to others. I WOULD NEVER COME BACK TO THIS HOSPITAL, NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE HERE!  I actually made an appointment to be seen in Eastern Massachusetts."

Went there for a suspected ""mild heart attack"", 2 hours in the waiting room, brought to a filthy room, 2 hours in that room waiting for even a nurse to come by. I was then told to ""alert staff if anything happened"", and when some symptoms began to return i pressed the 'help' button on the wall to get someone in the room, and the two nurses on staff proceeded to continue gossiping a distance from their desks, and after 3+ minutes of the 'help alarm' blasting, one of them walks over in a fit, smashes the mute button, and then calmly walks back to her friend and continues to chat away. I had to flag down a random nurse to get any help, I explained my situation to him and he immediately got me the help i needed and quickly scolded the other two nurses for not helping me. Both nurses then promptly came to my room and apologized for ignoring me and then returned to the staff area, where they glared at me and stared me down at every opportunity possible for the rest of the time i was there."

One nurse was extremely helpful, the other named Natasha, condescending and rude, even went as far as calling me impatient for asking if theres any news after 2 hours of silence. This is my 5th and last time going to this ED. No one deserves to be ignored and disrespected by their so called care takers. Disgusting. P.s. not once was I moved to a room, I was placed in the hallway and ignored for 3 hours."

"The quality of care given in the Joint Replacement Center is excellent almost beyond measure. Two nurses in particular are truly fine: Donna RN and Joyce LPN. The design of the patient care units and its bathrooms are exceptional for assisting people with mobility problems. The surgeon, Dr. McBride, is just excellent and personable as well.
I am retired nurse and spent an enormous amt. of time at the hospital for 4 days as my friend recovered from knee replacement surgery.
The team of nurses and PT personnel worked incredibly well together. The post-op PT classes (I witnessed 3) were excellent: Thank you Carl and Julie (Jewels).
As I live  in another state, I was totally unfamiliar with Northhampton; a volunteer, (Clifford) brought me outside and literally showed me how to get to the YMCA.
The Coffee Shop had fresh excellent pastries each day (sadly not low calorie). Literally everyone I came in contact with was friendly, personable and competent in their roles.
If this quality of care could be delivered in all our hospitals, the USA would have the best medical care on earth: Cooley Dickenson is a most amazing place."

"i'll start with the good. as a cancer patient, i received excellent care in Oncology. however, the ER is another matter. i went one night at 7 pm for a worsening cat bite (i'd already been to Urgent Care - GO THERE instead, people!!!) and was told at 1 AM when someone finally saw me to let the antibiotics have a chance to work. in the past i'd needed IV antibiotics for cat bites, but she didn't listen to me. i went home, i saw my doc the next day (so far i spent $30 co-pay on UC, $150 co-pay on ER, now $30 co-pay on dr) and it was worsening, cellulitis. could go septic. sure enough, within 2 hours redness and swelling grew enough so that i had to return to the ER at 6 PM. i was FINALLY seen (i was laying in a hallway, rooms full because people go to the ER instead of Urgent Care for everything when they don't need to) finally seen at 1 AM, told i needed - drum roll - IV antibiotics and had to be admitted, it was so bad. they didn't even get me to a room until 3 AM and i ended up admitted for 2 days and numerous IV antibiotic infusions and missed 3 days of work. and my co-pay was $350 for the hospital stay. if the PA had listened to me in the ER the first night, i would have been spared a whole lot of trouble and money, gotten 2 IV doses and been on my way. the 2nd ER visit was the busiest night they could remember - 37 people lining the hallway outside the ER as walk-ins. i have to wonder why the hell people don't go to Urgent Care because essentially, they are clogging the system and you know all 37 didn't require emergency assistance, trust me. BTW, my treatment IN the hospital when admitted was great. but i never should have needed that."

This hospital could be a much better hospital than it currently is. I think the number one problem at this place is that the doctors rely to heavily on pharmaceuticals. If you are admitted to this place you are treated more like a medical prisoner rather than a human being. I honestly don't think the doctors and nurses make accurate diagnosis every time. This place still uses an authoritarian healthcare model. I feel sorry for the people who became drug addicts because they were prescribed some of the most addictive and dangerous drugs in the world at this hospital. The healthcare system in america is falling apart and major changes need to be made. This hospital seems like it is behind the times when it comes to making legitimate changes that benefit all of society. Something needs to be done about emergency room wait times at this place. Also who gets to decide who gets treated first? This is the only hospital in Hampshire county and sometimes you have to wait hours on end just to see someone. I just don't get this place at all. It is very rare that I hear someone in the community talk about how great  a hospital this place is. My life has been negatively affected by this hospital and I am sure other people's lives have been hurt to. I just hope whoever runs this place can improve the hospital for the better so less people in the community have to suffer in pain and drug addiction.

"This place is THE BEST place to send your enemies.  When my in-law went there for arthritis pain, she was told that she was in acute liver failure and that they were going to start hospice.  Oh, the look on her face when she thought she was going to die!  Don't worry, she drove herself to a real hospital and was informed that she was not in liver failure and that they had no clue what CDH was talking about.  Tee hee!

Oh!  And another time I had to send a friend there because we found him highly intoxicated -- almost dead!  We thought twice about sending him there since, after all, he was a loved one and CDH has a penchant for leaving people to die -- but we figured we had no other choice.  It was a blast learning that he was escorted by police to a Quality Inn at 2:00AM because he was being a little rowdy.  A great idea, sending a drunk person to a hotel to ""sleep it off"".  Maybe he'll die, maybe he wont!  Hehe, I love the guessing games.

All in all, this hospital is a GREAT place to send somebody who you want to kill, but are too afraid to.  Why get YOUR hands dirty?  Just send them off to CDH to die from cruel negligence."

Three months later, I received the bill and it was more than 250$ even after reduction from my insurance!!! 250$ for just taking my blood?!!! Seriously?!!! Won't go there any more!!! I promise."

When speaking with their billing department after the fact, two out of the three billing representatives I spoke with were incredibly rude and one was outright condescending to me.  She raised her voice and insinuated I was stupid for not having the out of state claims address on hand.  When I told her I could pull it up on the internet, she snapped at me and told me that I wouldn't be able to and that it ""wasn't some address that I could just find on the internet.""  I said I would call back.  Not even 15 seconds after I hung up, I found it online on my provider's website.  When I called back, I got a different woman who was incredibly pleasant and kind with me and it was all the information I needed.

"One of the worst experiences I have ever had in a hospital. We were visiting my parents from out of town for Christmas when my 2-year old got badly dehydrated from a stomach virus and was lethargic and couldn't keep any liquids down. We brought her in hoping someone could give her an IV, but the doctor on call insisted it was not dehydration. They kept us there for over 8 hours, refusing to put in an IV or test for dehydration. At 7 o'clock that night, they finally did a blood test and came rushing back in, exclaiming that the blood tests showed she was (now) very severely dehydrated. They put her on an IV and she improved almost immediately, but at that point she had to be hospitalized overnight. Total cost: about $3,000."

"The review I posted last week  has disappeared and I was not the one who took it down. It was not offensive, just factual. This is information I learned since my visit.( won't  go through everything again  here. Before being  discharged discharged I was told by Reid Motha, who acted like I was imagining my symptoms--that my chest xray was ""normal."" When I followed up with my doctor she was surprised because the xray showed a 7mm nodule on my lung. I went to the er in an ambulance upon my doctor's orders after a diagnosis of pnuemoccoccal  pneumonia. I'm scheduled for a CAt scan now but would not have known  there was anything wrong if I hadn't followed up on my own."
"my mid wife was out of office on my appointment day, no one called or emailed me in advance to reschedule, I only found out about it when I got to the office. I had to reschedule my appointment at the office without being seeing by anyone. Very disrespectful to patients' schedule and lives. I made to the appointment after coordinating two small kids schedule and my work schedule. Very upsetting."
"Great local hospital with Alot of services. I personally have never had a problem. All the staff are nice, knowledgeable and explain everything to you and they  do things in a timely manner. I recommend going here ."
"Barely examined in the ER, Left with instructions to follow up with primary care dr...that cancels appt and forgets to write my prescription. Left in severe pain and heading back to the incompetent staff of the ER. No one knows what's going on around here. All of the staff is very ignorant and confused."
"The emergency room is extremely slow and at times staff is unprofessional. If your not an emergency in there definition of it, you wait an average of four to five hours. It makes me think twice before getting medical care. I shouldn't feel that way but after being a local for most of my life, that's just the way it is. For what we pay for insurance it should be catering to us, the ones paying them."

"This place should be shut down.  It is shockingly inept and criminally irresponsible for mental health.  They released a SPECIAL NEEDS 18 year old at 3:00am. No ride. No way home. He's now gone.  He has no phone.. he has no money.  I'm considering bringing a lawsuit due to their carelessness.  Do not let anyone you love go to this ""hospital"""

"It‚Äôs a heart touching place, the surgeon is great, the anesthetist is awesome, the nurses are marvelous & soaring‚Ä¶the nurse helped us to be calm, patience by sharing her own experience of her children regarding the surgeorical procedure, and Ms Martina is really generous and caring, she has done EVERY possible way to make my child comfortable in Post operation care, even though she dropped us in the parking lot by helping us to carry my child and stuffs with love.
May Almighty bless you, we love your smiling faces‚Ä¶"

"Gave birth at this hospital an awful experience. I had a controlling and insane midwife named Annie who refused to give me an epidural until I was 9cm and violated my concent multiple times- one or the most painful experience of my life. After my child was born multiple nurses probed and insisted on asking the race/ethnicity of my kid. My partner was disrespect multiple times, avoid."

"Let‚Äôs start with the waiting room filled with hippa violations, and the fact that we‚Äôve been here 3 hours in a room but haven‚Äôt taken her tempature. Better off googling your medical emergency then coming here. Plus the bed/floor and medical equipment is visibly dirty."
I went for a pre procedure COVID 19 test. The nurses were professional and kind. I waited 10 minutes in line. I have heard from many of my friends that they had much longer wait.
"Many times since 1982 have I been there at C.D.H. they took care of me promptly and profesionaly. There were incidents when My need to get here by car, bus or ambulance because of torsion, coma, bike crash, etc have been quickly handled and treated very well!
Their biling is reasonable, offering sliding scale payment and FREE care for this low-income patient.
They have been suportive to our meetings in Psych unit for 12-step and visits of patients.
Security has also been helpful during problems geting rides home in bad weather, etc."
"i would give it negative stars. it's a very, very bad ER. once they put air in my IV, and when i pointed it out, they went out and ""checked"" and then told me you'd only get an aneurysm from air in an artery, and this was a vein! meanwhile, i could feel the air in my veins. then, i had the flu, vomited a ton, and they refused me saline for three hours, even though i was literally begging and crying.

go to baystate in springfield if you at all, ever, have a choice. they're one of the best hospitals in the state, while cooley-dickinon has been investigated in the last two years for their high maternal and infant death rates (just for one example)."
"I went at 6:00 am, and after listening to how the nurses dinner at a local restaurant the night before went, I left at 7:15 am.  i left after never even seen by a triage nurse. I was the only person in the waiting room and when I left I was told ""sorry we had a busy night"""
My son was treated excellent.  They had a private room for us to stay as a family and helped with food by delivering a guest tray each meal.  The nurses are excellent and doctors
"brought my son to the ED for a minor injury. We were seen quickly and the nurse was compassionate and kind, which says a lot considering my son tried to kick her in the face,and spat on her (he has psychiatric special needs). She was AMAZING. My son is very hard to care for, and she didn't bat an eye. The PA we saw was very thorough and respectful. We were there for less than 2 hours total. This is my only experience with cooley dickenson but it was good enough that I thought I should share!"

"I was there about 2 weeks ago for the first time and I was treated like a king, the staff, especially the nurses on the fourth floor, Shonda and Samantha are outstanding, you girls made my time there comfortable, I was even given a nick name, humming bird lol. Thank You, Nelson"
"My insurance covered most of my bill, I paid the rest and was still sent a collection notice. Why?
Spoke with the collection agency as I'm looking at my cancelled check online and he tells me to call them. I call and speak to someone in billing and she says they had a computer switch over for 2 weeks and my account didn't get updated, so it got reported. but promised it will be manually updated. I'm hoping that's the end of it, but not feeling the love."

"These blonde bimbos at the ER reception desk keep saying ""they don't know"" to our questions about where our mom is. It's not like they have many patients right now.... They're gossiping and eating Doritos with their stupid window open and it stinks. You aren't getting paid to be useless and gossip. Shut this place down or get new staff. Seriously."

"Staff is overall attentive to what I say and followup is excellent. Courteous, efficient service is what makes Cooley Dickinson stand out from other health care services I have experienced."
"They came to get me from school after I had unbearable back pain and couldn't wait for the 11:30 am meds to come (it was 10:15). It is now 1:03 pm and I'm laying on the side of a hallway in one of those weird beds while everybody passes me by. Good news though, I sat in a weird way and my pain is mostly gone so I just wanna get outta here now."
"Very bad service in emergency department people are dying with pain out side and staff have pizza party üéâ in side around 11 to 12 pm 6 dominos different delivery and only two patients out waiting for 4 hours and half is empty management need to watch night time staff
üôèüôè please"
"Wow if i could rate any lower it would reach the core of the earth..... place sucks..... waited hours.. still waiting by the time the they call me back to the ER trump will most likely be reelected... the blondes at the front desk area should start their own reality tv show cuz not only are they horrible  at their jobs seems like they have a lot of drama and do nothing other then talk about broken nails and eat food.
... i rather catch  the plaque then come here again.... its called a er but they about as fast as a hermit crab if you have a true emergency  and this place is the closest  make sure you have a power of attorney and you will made out cuz you wont make it"

"My doctor and nurse (radiation oncology are FANTASTIC !!! )
Parking and getting down to their offices is a rat puzzle... There is never a receptionist when you walk in the North entrance !   The signage to find radiation oncology is really bad  very unclear !!!!!"
I've spend a lot of time in hospitals for someone without a chronic condition and Cooley Dickinson has been by far my favorite. The wait times in the ER are next to none and the staff is friendly and helpful.
This is the worse hospital that a person can go to the nurses and staff are so unprofessional they don't care about the patients after 3 hours waiting with my 8 year old had to leave because he was never call and he was vomiting and extremely stomach  pain sad to say
"It really wasn't as sanitary as it could be.
Hope that it can be addressed"
Unprepared surgical staff!  What a nightmare!
"I like Cooley and I am taken care of very well there, but that parking lot is ridiculous. I drove around for 30 minutes trying to find a space, and in the end I only managed to by stalking someone as they walked to their car. That is stupid. They need to figure something out."
My experience with the Oncology Department has been fabulous.  They are among the most competent and caring medical professionals that I have ever encountered.
Staff were very attentive and helpful
My grandfather went there last night by ambulance they put him in a room in pain and just left him there all night to be in pain no doctor came in to check on him until morning. What kind of wack doctors work there that they over look a 65year old man with no water or anything
"Been waiting for 5 hours in the ER now with a seriously ill family member. She's at a 9 on the pain scale. Have not yet seen a doctor. This isn't a hospital, it's a train station- all anyone is doing is waiting."
"Worst hospital ever!  The wait time in the ER is beyond ridiculous , don't ever go there bleeding or you'll die from waiting no joke.  There is no staff and nobody to help, SAVE YOURSELF AND GO ELSEWHERE"
"worse er to go to for anything.i went there dec 17 2013 cause i serverly messed up my foot.well dr.conner told me nothing was wrong  well first off he listed the right foot when it was my left that needed the cast scan.well 4 months latter had dr norris get a mri and cat scan done well found out my left foot was serverly broken and did not heal up right and then 2 months ago found out my foot is basically mush no way to do surgry,so be careful or smart and go to the greenfield er they are the best hospital out there close anyways."

Understaffed lab. Had to wait an hour to DROP OFF a specimen. The specimen was time sensitive and I ended up having to repeat the process. Complete waste of time.
"The pits. Low to no respect for their patients. There's a reason that folks around the Pioneer Valley refer to ""CDH"" as ""Come Die Here""."
It was great had my hip replaced in January every thing went fine out in 4 days.No problem to date had Dr. Shea
"If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all.  My baby was born at Cooley Dickinson Hospital and I had excellent care."
At the Cancer Center. Staff was very polite professional and caring. Explained thoroughly the procedure. I had a wonderful experience .
"This is a great local hospital. I was born here, my bones have been set here, I've had multiple procedures here. I completely trust and recommend this hospital."
"Only made it to check-in after 2 hours, wonder why it's taking so long to look over at a nurse taking a selfies, probably try doing your job!"
Almost everything takes 10x as long here due to poor communication between staff and forgetting about patients
Very pleasant and accomodating
Worst hospital in the area. Im not sure why but it seams that no one in this place can give a proper I.V. nor do they care to ignollage when someone knows their medical history.
Been sitting in we waiting room for hours. Watching people come and go while nurses at reception window are having pizza delivered.
Going to the hospital is never pleasant but this was a good experience.  Everyone was friendly and I was treated well.
I used to work there so it's difficult to give any result other than excellent üëç
I wish I could give them 0 stars! The wait for an emergency check in was 8 hrs
Excellent doctors and support staff!!  Go to Baystate and compare- NOT even in the same league!
Checked myself in for crisis prevention.  Staff was beyond amazing and helpful.  Very clean facility very friendly staff
Worst experience I've ever had. Dirty rooms. Unprofessional staff. Avoid this place.
I only waited 5 minutes for my walk in x-ray
"doesnt care about patients or HIPPA, I would not recommend going here ever."
Truly caring nurses. Very careful to protect patients.
Nurses and doctors took great care of me.
Rude stuck up doctors and nurses very rude to people ..
"Wonderful staff, very efficient service. Professionals take the time to explain what's going on. Much appreciated."
"Very well cared for in this hospital. Clean and modern, friendly staff."
"Emergency room were efficient, friendly and considerate. Thanks!"
My husband received such terrific care I now volunteer.
"The  Best experience  ever, doctors and nurses, all staff were Great!!"
Triage check in over an hour ago. Sitting in waiting room with pulsating pain.
"My idiot friend got super drunk and these guys were kind enough to take care of him, 10/10 would bring drunk friends to again"
A caring place . Excellent patient service.
"Great staff! Friendly, personable, and very helpful :)"
Very üëç helpful
They forgot a prescription when they sent over
Long waiting
Always caring doctors
worker was extremely rude to me on the phone.
Quickly made the right diagnosis.
Best circus Ever!!
This is a really nice place
Help other people
Professional care
