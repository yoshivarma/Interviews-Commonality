"A review! I am an international graduate student with family! The Application  process was well facilitated by Jennifer, who explained me everything I need to know about the lease contract. Moving process was very informal,  they only gave me a folder with the keys without any explanation about the entire property. I had to find by myself where is the laundry, the trash deposit, etc,  but this is a minor thing.
We have been living here for three months, the apartment is a nice size even for a family like mine.  The carpeting was brand new! The payment service and maintenance request is through a Northland web portal, which is very convenient.

Maintenance staff are very helpful and quick to respond all our request and inquiries. The gym is great, it has good machines.

The location is convenient. Even though is not walking distance, is close to downtown, to Hadley, everywhere. The PVTA route 31 helps a lot.  There is a bus stop just in the middle of the property and another one so close.
There are many green areas, which we usually use with my kids. I wish there was a playground for them.

Moving to another country brings many challenges, but we find in The boulders our new Home in the US."
"If I could rate this place 0 stars I would. The management is horrendous. They do not care to help you at all. I tried calling the office 4 times during business hours to schedule a move out appointment and nobody answered, after answering my email which told me to call them.... The move out appointment was scheduled 3 times. The first time they agreed to do a Saturday move out, then acted like we never scheduled it and refused Saturday. Then we scheduled through email and I still received a call weeks later asking to schedule an appointment. They are completely unorganized. Devin was late to the move out inspection, blamed it on an emergency, spent 2 minutes looking the place over and then left claiming another emergency before having maintenance drive him back to his office. Management at the time, Jenn,  also completely ignored my roommate and I when someone in the building was vandalizing our door and writing swear words on it. They did not talk to us in person or even come look at the door themselves. Jenn called us later to say someone would look at the door. Maintenance came to scrape off one part of the vandalism and said they would come back to paint. The door remained unpainted until the day we left. I attached photos of this vandalism so everyone can see how little they care about resident's safety. The walls are thin and you can hear everything your neighbors are doing, including having sex. Hallways smell awful. Only way to get some sleep is to live on the third floor or buy earplugs. Not worth the money for some old appliances and creaky floors."
The management has changed and still the same problems. Jen had problems running this place so does devin. Nothing about this place is good over priced for college kids. An make sure you keep your paper work and all emails. Mantaince will give you the best they got. An I say this because managers are cheap and don’t have time or money to replace what’s broken. So they do the best with what they have. Can’t put caulking on everything and fix it. Trash gets thrown next to dumpster and maintenance has to throw it away. Managers never in office hard to contact them over the phone. They even want to keep your security deposit after our place was move in  ready. Besides the rat's that would walk all over the place I wouldn’t want a family to move in. Sorry but this place unless it’s completely remodeled is a 1200 as is today. Hope this helps the next victims coming in.

"Oof. Where to start. First off, we are trying to move and I would be very cautious about renting from The Boulders. Back in Feb they switched companies and they already poor management basically plummeted to zero. The office isn’t even available to confirm our residency so we can apply to a different apartment. They raised rent to about 1.7k for small two bedrooms that are thin, overheated and falling apart. Maintenance is impossible to find because the number to maintenance has been a dead line since the originally company was bought out. Our sink quite literally exploded one night and our fire alarm was taken out of our apartment and never replaced. One of the doors to the blocks does not work as well posing a huge safety risk. I believe they’re trying to take advantage of wealthy parents who don’t pay attention to where their students are staying and international people who are naive to American renting laws. The location is pretty and convenient to everything but the issues are becoming a danger. The person who replies to this will tell you to call them and we’re so sorry but the reality is that you’re paying upwards of 1.7k a month for apartments made from particle board and dry wall. Luckily we live in a block that is relatively quiet but the students can become pretty rowdy around the property as well. If you have no choice but to move here read your rights as a tenant and if you’re a parent paying their child’s rent consider the unsafe environment you’re putting them in. Two stars because it’s a beautiful area and our neighbors are helpful.

Update: we are still having issues with our toilet which is becoming a severe health hazard but our maintenance request has been “closed.” In order to get any maintenance work done we quite literally have to call the corporate office in New York City. Even when maintenance to the apartment is successfully called they often don’t even show up. And as I type this the water was shut off without prior warning. It sucks that it’s still cheap enough to allow me and my partner to save for a house but the safety issues are becoming so immense that I often wonder if it’s worth it. Please PLEASE consider these reviews before sending your young and inexperienced students here. We are lucky to be elder millennials that have been around the block with bad landlords before but an 18 year old kid is going to end up in a horrible situation. Prepare yourself if you have no choice."

I am an international graduate student at UMass Amherst living at the Boulders. The move-in was smooth and well facilitated by Natilie Besner. The office answered a lot of our pre move-in queries patiently and helped with issues in the unit post move-in as well. The property itself is well laid out with lots of open space. There are no shops withing walking distance but it is well connected through the PVTA bus lines and has a bus stop right on the property grounds.  The only downside would be the creaky floors.

"Would have been 4-5 stars before but the new company, NBM Group, is destroying this place and massively hiking the rent. I couldn't review NBM Group with a 1 star directly since they changed their name from North Brooklyn Management, if you look them up by their previous name you can witness all the one star reviews they are trying to hide from."

"The walls and ceilings are paper thin, you will end up waking up at 3/4am regularly if your neighbours choose to party or gather in groups. Rent keeps getting increased and it now makes much more sense to live at any other property in Amherst considering how isolated this place is from the rest of town. Initially we even got billed extra for water that was clearly their fault (issue with the flush tank). I had to literally search every water outlet in the house and then found this inconspicuous issue. Their maintenance had come and checked the house when i complained about the inflated water bill and they had given it the all clear. Was not reimbursed for this excessive water bill either, the staff I have dealt with at the office seems extremely apathetic and indifferent. Closet doors are missing or misaligned. Many doors don't open or shut. Window screens weren't attached properly and we told they won't fix it. Would not recommend anyone to live here."

"There are many other apartments nearby, which are more worthwhile considering. There was weird smell inside the building. Interior and appliance were old. Transportation to UMass is not the easiest, and it is relatively far from the school.  The rental office staff were not friendly, especially when one tenant was moving out and leaving the other(s) behind. As international students, we found it challenging to communicate with the staff smoothly. Seriously, miscommunication should not have been there."

"As a UMass juniors, myself and two roommates had an great experience living at the Boulders. The location was perfect--8 minute drive to campus-- shopping, restaurants, supermarkets, and downtown Amherst all within minutes. The apartment itself was spacious and was suitable to all of our needs as college students. The three of us got great use out of the gym they have on sight, and appreciated all of the other great amenities such as convenient laundry and free spacious parking. Jenn, Ashley, Katie and the rest of the staff are friendly and welcoming and effectively accommodate to residents needs. Would highly recommend!"

"Incredible place! Jen Stafford keep wonderful communication and the whole staff is so friendly and always responsive. The gym is beautiful and laundry room is SO CLEAN, which is awesome! Location wise it has it all; close to Amherst Center, grocery shopping in Hadley, bike paths and trials. Walking distance to all three but The Boulders also has tons of parking and a bus stop right here! Loving my stay  -Grace :)"

"A review! The move in process was well facilitated by staff, and everyone working was very kind and courteous. The apartments are a nice size for a first apartment or a college apartment. The carpeting is brand new and the appliances have been great! Maintenance and staff response time has been very speedy, and quick to help. Ashley specifically has been so great to my roommates and I, always reaching out and making sure we have everything we need. The gym is a great aspect, as well as the beautiful landscaping and friendly neighbors with furry friends! Something I love about renting here is that there is a Northland Apartments app that makes maintenance requests & payments very user friendly and painless! MUCH easier and MUCH more put together than previous apartments I have rented in the Amherst area.

I have one complaint which brings it down to 4/5 stars: The apartment ceiling lights are fluorescents and have a strobe-like effect every time we go to turn them on, which is not very pleasant. I reached out to maintenance and was told that’s ‘just how it is’, which was pretty disappointing. My roommates and I had to purchase alternative lighting for all of the rooms because the flickering was borderline unbearable. We were told the same when the water pressure in the shower was so strong that it hurt to take a shower. That there wasn’t anything they could do but install a new shower head… if we were to buy one at our expense (which we did).

I wish they were able to replace the lighting to spare us the expense, but an otherwise overall positive experience. I recommend to first apartment renters, college students, and anyone looking for a pleasant and inexpensive place to rent! (Maybe you’ll have better luck putting your foot down with maintenance LOL)."
"My son and his roommates had a good experience living at the Boulders over the past year. Convenient location to downtown Amherst, route 9 shopping, and UMass. The apartment was spacious and comfortable. If they had any maintenance issues, they called it in, and it was taken care of right away. They even received a new refrigerator in a timely way. It was great to have a gym onsite too!"
"I just moved to Amherst and have been looking at apartments for quite some time. The experience with Boulders has been a pleasant one! Right from the application process, their representative, Jennifer, has been completely transparent about our application status and our ability to get an apartment. When an apartment was available, we were informed promptly and we decided to go for a tour. We were shown the apartment by Kaitlyn who explained everything clearly and answered all our questions! She also explained the next steps and we were all set to rent an apartment here.
Overall it was a warm and welcoming experience!

Haven't started living there yet but looking forward to it! 😁"

The apartment is extremely hot regardless of what the thermostat is set at.  Very hard to sleep in an environment like this.  Living at The Boulders has an impact in your quality of life.   “Buyer” beware!!
Ashley was amazing with the entire application process. I had a unique situation that required me emailing her back and forth over the course of a few weeks and she was extremely patient and helpful. If it wasn't for her my roomate and I would not have been approved to live here. Very thankful for the great staff during the initial processes.

"This is my second time living at The Boulders. I lived here from 2011-2014 and just returned to Amherst in July of 2021. The price is decent for Amherst for the amount of space offered, along with the heat being included in rent, 24/7 emergency maintenance, ample parking, bus route access, etc. The on-site staff are pleasant and helpful.

HOWEVER, the actual company that runs the place is kinda sleazy. There is a privacy policy that requires you to allow them to give access to your contact info to third party companies and there's no way to opt out of that clause. They require rental insurance but force your insurance company to jump through hoops and offer really specific language and threaten to cancel your application if it's not exactly how they want it. They own two different complexes in Amherst and they definitely overcharge and have outrageous income caps considering they mostly serve college students. I don't like their policies but hey, it's cheaper than anything else in town."

"UMass grad student. I didn't end up renting here, but the Kaitlyn in the front office was extremely helpful and transparent about apartment availabilities, the pros/cons of the complex vs. others in the area, and the perks of different individual rooms.

I toured the apartments in person and I must say, they are *extremely* spacious and really high quality. The photos online simply don't do it justice at all. Would definitley recommend taking a look in-person if you're on the fence. I have met or talked with 5-6 people living here and there were only positive reviews. Many of the students stayed here multiple years.

Random notes not found elsehwere online: 1) the gym is really well-kitted with pretty much every machine you could want. Lacking a squat rack/big free weights besides dumbbells, but much more complete than any other apartment gym I could find by a long shot. 2) The rooms have spots in the wall for AC units, and their team will help you install one if you get one, so you don't have to do a window unit. 3) Units don't include a microwave 4) There are multiple laundry rooms within the complex, one within each 4-building joined complex, so you don't have to walk that far to do laundry. 5) The grounds are really nicely manicured, with lots of lawn space and trees/plants."

"My roomates and I lived here for a year and would NOT recommend it. The front office was incredibly challenging to deal with, passive aggressive, and will do just about everything in their power to squeeze as much money as they can from low-income individuals (college students). We were charged $380 for ""cleaning"" which consisted of maintenance carrying a bedframe and air conditioner to the dumpster right outside of the apartment. Aside from that, the quality of the apartments is very low relative to the rent prices - thin walls, cabinets falling apart, broken doors, etc, all of which occurred before we moved in. If that wasn't enough, they tacked on $80 to replace the blinds that were broken before we moved in. Don't be fooled by the pictures on their website, go see for yourself and you will see the true, terrible quality of this property and the buildings.

Also, if you plan to use the gym that they advertise so proudly, keep in mind that it is very small, messy, and doesn't have good machines to use, not even a bench or squat rack. You will almost have to have a car to live here, unless you plan on taking the bus everyday as the location isn't within walking distance of anything significant.

Unfortunately, places like this will be continue to be rented out because their entire business model preys on college students without the option to live elsewhere. Do not live here unless it is your last option."

"Just ended my one year lease there and am glad to not be returning. Dingy, dirty hallways that smelled most of the time. The water temperature always changed on its own, outdated and cheap  fixtures, maintenance refused to install my a/c on a Saturday during a heat wave (after stating that they had to do it) stating it was not an emergency. The walls and floors are paper thin and I could hear my downstairs neighbors’ conversations as if they were in my own living room.  Extremely overpriced. Most of the complex population seems to be loud, rowdy, UMASS students so there were very loud parties in my building into all hours of the night. I’d suggest looking else where for an apartment."

"My wife and I are new residents and we are really happy here. Office staff (yay Kristen, Casey and Jennifer) are responsive, kind, and easy to work with. Maintenance folks are fabulous and most problems are fixed quickly and well.

We have a dog and a cat, and while we do hear our upstairs neighbors walking around, it’s no louder than other apartments I’ve lived in. There is plenty of room for the dog to run and she’s provided a lovely way to get to know the neighbors

It’s easy to get from here to shopping areas, and yet we’re off the main road in the midst of several farms- so we have the sense of being in the country but not isolated.   Very happy to be here!!"

It has been a great place to live. The management has helped us in every way by accommodating and helping us with any due process with respect to any document. The rent is also affordable in the area and the facilities such as gym etc are also quite helpful to have.
"Nice apartment, very roomy. Good staff, very readily available and fixed any issues we had very quickly. I did have a smoker in the building who didn't listen to the emails telling them to stop, but that's more of a tenant problem than a landlord problem as I'm sure they would have stopped the person if we could find out who it was."
"I moved into the boulders at the end of my sophomore year of college. They managed to fear monger the four of us into believing we *had* to start our lease at the beginning of April. The four of us all had expensive dorms we were staying in until mid may. So right off the bat they swindled us out of a months rent. When we moved into the apartment, it was disturbingly dirty and out of order. I was very upset because they had refused to show us the apartment ahead of time. When we moved in we found that there was almost no natural lighting, and one of the bedrooms had a very low ceiling, creating one cramped room and one master bedroom for us four to share. I spent hours cleaning the fridge on our arrival, just to discover that it was broken. The freezer leaked water into the fridge and spoiled any food we attempted to save for ourselves. After many failed attempts on maintenance to repair it, they finally replaced it. It took at least a month or two of us four living without a functioning fridge before that happened. I almost lost my mind, we didn’t have the money to waste so much food.  When we moved in, we attempted to open the dishwasher to discover the entire machine fell out of its place in the counter when we opened the door. It was also incredibly disgusting and had long dark hairs in it??? Another thing I had to clean myself. The shower was similarly a mess, and was stained permanently. While we were living there we started having a mouse problem. Thankfully my cat kept catching them. I would see the mice in our unit as well as in the hallway area. I once saw a mouse on the outside of the building crawl inside through a hole. It was definitely a building wide problem. Living in the boulders was one of the worst decisions I ever made, and as I age I look back with disgust at how they took advantage of a bunch of 20 and 21 year olds who were just trying to complete their education. They definitely recognized that we didn’t have the experience or guidance to advocate for ourselves and demand what we were legally entitled to (a clean functioning apartment on day ONE). They always consistently had poor reviews reflecting my experiences, and seeing all these brief positive, recent reviews leads me to believe they incentivized residents leaving positive reviews somehow"

"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would without hesitation. The apartments are dated AND overpriced. The photos that are on the website are the leasing office. Staff is VERYYY rude, especially Jennifer, who is a WITCH ON A BROOM. Don't come here. Run away as fast as you can. Southpoint is truly better. Oh and, this is  isn't going to be seen because it'll be taken down by YOU, Jennifer."

"Office staff and maintenance crew are amazing and will do everything in their power to help you.

The gym is awesome. Free, but small. Pretty much everything you need.

The laundry system is pretty weird, but it works. The machine to get the cards is odd, only takes cash, doesn't take 1s.

The floors are paper thin, so if you have any noise sensitivity while sleeping and working... ONLY get a 3rd floor unit here. This is why I couldn't give it a 5 star review. The office gave us a free transfer to a 3rd floor unit, so the office employees themselves get 6 stars.

Bus stop(s) are conveniently located. If you have a car, you're 10-15 minutes from UMass, and 5-10 minutes from everything located on Rt 9 in Amherst/Hadley. Tons of farms & trails nearby.

Pet friendly, lots of pupperonis roaming around with their owners. Seems like a solid place for kids to grow up and play around."

"I’ve been here for a year and I can honestly say I enjoyed my stay here. During the summer, I had an ant problem but no other bugs. It’s pretty quiet around here too. I liked staying on the third floor. The apartments are outdated, but we made it home for the time being. The only reason I’m not renewing my lease is because we’re moving out of state. I would most definitely recommend these apartments to someone."

"I stayed here for about a year while attending UMass. Few maintenance request we sent, were responded and fixed. However I must say that the apartment was not sturdy and we could hear people from above walking/talking, it was difficult to concentrate and study. The walls are very thin, same goes for floors/roof. The gym is a descent for light things, but dont expect too much. I was constantly annoyed by all the drilling and road maintenance all spring, and guess what the walls are thin. Not worth the high rent they charge."

"The application process was a little tricky, but Ashley was super helpful during it! She was very patient with us and responded quickly as we had a lot of questions. Excited to move in!"
"I have been living here for approximately one year and really like this place for a number of reasons. First, there are two bus stops that are really close, one is even inside the community. The buses come here every 15 minutes making it the most frequent route in town. It is a nice and quiet neighborhood and atleast in our building the noise isn't much of a problem. Our neighbors upstairs have a dog which runs and causes disturbance at times though. The community also has a nice bbq area which gave us a place to have small gatherings. Above all, the management has been really nice all year long, especially Kelly. The always came on time for all the work orders and I couldn't be happier with them. I would highly recommend this place."
null
null
"Rent is reasonable and apartments are decent. Staff working in the office can be rude and unhelpful, they often do not know their own rules. Hallways smell bad and carpet clearly needs to replaced of cleaned at the least. Have had to call maintenance for issues with the shower and fridge multiple times, they respond quickly but sometimes we need the same problem fixed multiple times."
null

"I moved in a month ago, and i like it here so far.  The management is nice, the rent isn't so bad, the utilities are fine.  Maintenance just replaced all the windows in my building.  Took forever and was noisy, but now the windows are all awesome.  Parking is pretty ample.  There's not really a noise issue most of the time. The hallways smell kinda funny.  And there are a LOT of Asians, but i mean whatever, I'm no racist, it's not like, a problem, man."
"Staff at the office are very friendly and considerate. Especially Jennifer who helped me with the return of old A/C and the installation of new A/C and help me understand all other troublesome emails regarding issues that I once had difficulty understanding.

There is a bus stop for bus 31 right in the middle of the Boulders. But on Saturday) it comes once an hour (and longer for Sunday). But if you have a car, this won’t be an issue. And Boulders in somewhat in the middle of the Amherst downtown and Walmart/Trader Joes/Wholefood/Target, so that makes everything quite reachable.

Use of washing machines tend to be crowded sometimes and you can only top up you laundry card in the gym. I hope this whole laudray experience could be improved in near future.

I have stayed here for less than a year so far and my experience has been greate. Recommended."
"This has easily been the worst place I have ever lived in my entire life. The people who live here are truly horrible. It is either loud horrible college kids or just generally awful people. The building is falling apart as any time our above neighbors move the floor creaks so loud it can be at times deafening. The walls are paper thin so you can hear everything anyone does. There is no quiet in this place. I have talked to the staff numerous times about the problems we are having and they do nothing. Please do not bring an animal here for though it is allowed, our cat is frightened all the time because of the constant yelling from our horrid neighbors across the hall or the relentless stomping and creaking from above. If we could leave right now we would. Never live here, find somewhere else. I have lived in eight different places over the last five years and this is by far the worst."

"Pretty nice apartments at a pretty nice location, right along the bus route. The staff there is friendly, their office is conveniently located and easy to contact, and any issues that came up with the apartment were handled relatively swiftly. If you're looking for a place to live, I guess you could say the Boulders ROCKS ha."
A great place to live! Staff was very helpful throughout every step of the rental process and responded to emails very quickly. Apartments are very nice and spacious.
"very poor management , everything is usually hotchpotch.
The staff enters and changes stuff forcefully without consideration of you are asleep and does modification.
The parking lots are closed abruptly , even if no work is happening.
They management is rude and  torcher with ill placed of towing vehicle for no reason , with parking lots scheduled for work days or weeks later.
The waste management is very poor , several time the trash is not picked for days , even complete week.
The handling of dump is also poor, usually they are uncovered , and smell a lot after rain, some of them are placed without thought in parking right front of your window."

"WORST PLACE TO LIVE IN AMHERST THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE I NEED TO USE THE BATHROOM BUT THEY DONT WANNA COME TO FIX MY TOILET EVERYTHING BROKE MAINTENANCE DONT DO NOTHING BUT TELL YOU WHAT THEY CANT DO THE PEOPLE RUDE , PLUS THEY KEPT MESSING OUR LEASING PAPERS UP WE HAD TO SIGN THEM 30 SOMETHING PAGES LEASE LIKE 3+ TIMESSSSS"
"I guess those rating 4 or 5 stars live on the 3rd floor because they dont have to bear noise from someone living above. If you choose to live on 1st or 2nd floor, so trust me you'd be regret. It's due to the fact that any time our above neighbors move the floor creaks terribly loud. What can be worse that you have neighbors keeping moving all the night long that you coulnt have a good night's sleep? That happened to me. Think twice!"

"Apartments are specious. Two PVTA bus stops near by so it is easy to go to downtown Amherst. However, there is no store near by for groceries or stationary etc."
"Apartment was filthy when I moved in, multiple appliances missing/broken. Staff was disrespectful and would routinely ignore maintenance requests. This place scammed me out of my security deposit when I moved out, I wish I could give negative stars."
awful apaprtment. never give back the deposite.
Very easy process with little to no problems whatso ever. Jennifer was super helpful during the entire process of applying!
I've been here for a couple of years now. The staff are friendly and great to work with. Glad to call this place my home.
Jenn was really helpful with the entire application process and super quick in answering all our queries as well.
Great maintenance staff. They allow dogs. Nice size rooms.
The apartments are spacious and maintenance service is great.  Overall good experience
Office and maintenance are amazing. Great place to live
"Great staff. Very responsive!
Peaceful neighborhood as well."
"Apartments are in good size.
Just one bathroom"
"Very far from UMass Amherst, and Amherst Downtown. There are no stores near by."
above average compared to the apts in north amherst
The office there is the worst ever. Management is horrible.
Great place to live!
Nice place to call home
Excellent!
Excellent living
Awfully service
