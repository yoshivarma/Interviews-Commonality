"Fans…hear me out. I NEVER give 5 stars, but honestly, there’s nothing more I could ask of a cafe.  I just got chai but it was delicious.  It was my first time having chai.  My beautiful friends were all very pleased with their beautiful sandwiches/burritos.  They did give my pal Pai’s order to someone named Pat, but that’s an easy mistake so I give them a pass.  Would totally come again, but unfortunately I don’t think I will be in this area ever again."
I recently went her for an early lunch while I was out.  I have a very picky child and didn't think I could find something he would eat.  When I walked in the atmosphere was amazing.  The people were so nice and the food was delicious.   I give props to this Cafe and the really nice gentleman who runs it.
"Love this place. I go here all the time for food and smoothies! The Kale Crush smoothie is so yummy (lots of fruit in there too). It's a nice cafe to work in if it's not too busy. And great fun to sit outside!

Vegetarian options: Vegetarian and vegan options! Good plant based food options"

"Placed a big group order and they delivered it perfectly. Sebastian and the staff were beyond helpful and accommodating, super pleasant experience! Food was incredible too!"
"This place really works for students and people who need some rest and study while drinking coffee or tea. You can also find all organic food, even organic farm bread here. Here you can also find bagel with cream cheese and salmon! Yes, salmon bagel :) eat well feel good."
"if I designed a sandwich place, it would be just like the Works. the quality of their ingredients the friendliness of their stuff their big beautiful spacious Cafe with nice wood tables, they really have perfected things. I love this place. yummy fresh ingredients tomatoes pesto cheese really nice bread grape soup what more could you want?"

So many great things to choose from and great service overall. Fantastic for outdoor dining. I visited multiple times for breakfast and lunch.
"Very chilled, relaxed place. I only got a Chai latte but it was delicious. Friendly staff. Great place to hangout and have a conversation."
"Hi , my reason for the 5 stars ⭐️ the food was really good hit the spot !!yummy !!!!  ☺️
The only problem was the customer service, no friendly person or staff I ordered my food to go , I was in  hurry to get to my job I did not mind to wait. One of the staff was putting another order into a bag doing her job the same staff member here is the reason I have 0 stars to customer services! because I got to put my order into the bag myself of course I don’t mind at all is my food but am I the customer there has well  ??? , I was so confused at that moment. when I ordered a bag to put my food away and her expression said enough. I believe she did not want to work at that time , Thanks for making me feel bad has a customer."

"Very comfortable place to visit & relax with a friend while sipping coffee and snacking on some delicious Mac & cheese or baked goods. The muffins are great, the scones are outstanding."
"Everything I've tried has been good, esp their chicken salad. Staff and ambience is always nice."
"I was really impressed with my first trip to The  Works Cafe. The store front is clean, open, and welcoming. The menu was easy to parse quickly with a nice selection but not so much as to feel cluttered or hard to navigate. The cashier and the order expediter werr friendly and professional.

I ordered a Dagwood sandwich, orange-cranberry scone, and cold brew coffee. The portions were generous without being excessive and every thing tasted fresh. The sandwich bread as you might expect from a bakery was excellent. The frosted scone was a great treat and also a good size.

I am looking forward to my next visit.Dine in: Yes
Outdoor seating: Yes
Takeout: Yes"
"Chillax regional chain for coffee, breakfast,  lunch with sandwiches, baked goods, salads, and smoothies."
Always welcoming and make delcious Brunchy type food. For breakfast and Chic-y food lovers.
"Im on the Dr. Gundry diet. When away from home its sometimes tricky to get meals right. I had the turkey bacon avacado sandwitch. It comes on sourdough bread (good) and it was easy to pull the tomato slices out (I could have asked to not include, but forgot).. Pleasant atmosphere, friendly staff. Put The Works on your list when visiting Amherst MA."

"What a cute place in Amherst Center.  Had a few different sandwiches and bagels.  Everything was great, served fast and hot.  Wanted a coffee but i just finished one.  Really casual with large tables to sit together or to do class work.  Good prices."
Ordered sandwiches and sat outside.....too cold inside.  Great food.
"Friendly, helpful staff, but a generic corporate chain decor and ambience."
"Food is so so. Good for students, cheap options but that doesn't mean you reduce your standards of what food should taste like and how it should be served. The service was friendly. Owner needs to make food more presentable. Good stuff on the menu."
"I want to like this cafe because I spend so much time here, the vibe is great and the staff is nice, but I’m sorry to say the mocha is probably one of the worst mochas I’ve ever had to pay for. I’ve tried it multiple times and it’s consistently bad, it’s probably just the recipe that’s garbage. The everything bagel egg sandwich w spinach and cheese was also pretty unseasoned.

Edit: Bumping up a star for the vibe, high-speed internet, and incredibly nice staff. Although, I stand by my evaluation of the mocha and the bagel."

"The Works is a great choice to bring the kids and family to dine in or take out. And, they have more than just bagels. I ordered two works bagels (that's New York for cream cheese, lox, tomato, capers, and onion), a Tuna Panini, and Bacon Mac & cheese. Because some in my party have sensitivities, there were modifications to my order.  The food was ready in a timely manner and all the details were made to perfection. A+"
"Ordered via DoorDash an hour before the restaurant closed, plenty of time, and they cancelled the order 10 min before it should have been arriving. No other places accepting deliveries now. I’d normally assume DoorDash is to blame but my dasher was already there so clearly the order went through. 3 stars because I’ve ordered from here before and the food is good when they don’t cancel your order at the last minute."
"The first time I was there, I ordered a cappuccino. It was cold!! They changed it for me. The second time, there was a long hair in the chocolate croissant!!! They changed that too! Also the people are not nice/friendly either! There won’t be any third time!"
I did enjoy this place. The atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed. The police was clean and well-lit. The menu was surprisingly diverse and large. Service was awesome with friendly Happy People serving you. My big complaint was it seems to be quite expensive. Especially for a college town. The coffee was pretty good! And they have a gluten-free selection that wasn't awesome but wasn't bad either.

"I love this place! The Works is quick, delicious, and convenient. They have many gluten free options as well as options for vegans, vegetarians, etc. They can make sandwiches to order with very fresh ingredients and have a great selection of pastries and breads. I personally love their mocha latte as well. They also have a few punch cards for loyal customers!"

"It's got decent coffee and sandwiches. The prices aren't horrible but they're definitely playing to the hipster crowd with what they charge. Everything is wicked clean and the staff is friendly. The parking is on-street since there's no dedicated parking, but that's the reality of most Amherst businesses.

All in all, it's good food and coffee. It's just a little expensive for the area that it's in. Everything is organize and natural though."

"Food arrived late and cold. Ok, microwave it. Problem solved right? Nope. I just heated up nothing but a bagel with red onions on it when I ordered a bacon egg and cheese with red onions. I did NOT click ANY option to remove those items from my order, why in the sweet hell would ANYBODY ever order just this???"
"I really like this place, they have a great vibe and cool atmosphere. The food is very well prepared and super fresh ingredients. I would highly recommend this hidden gem to anyone who like fresh, clean authentic and tasty food."
"It's a very lively atmosphere with good music and pretty decor. I got a mocha latte, which was okay, I liked that they steamed the milk, but it was really only a step above Dunkin donuts. But then I got the farmers vegetable sandwich, and oh my goodness did it kiss my tastes buds as if exploding into sweet lightning. Ten out of ten, that was a sandwich I would recommend.

I like that I can stare out the window at the Starbucks across the street and feel just a bit more hipster than that crowd.

Overall: GOOD SANDWICHES, and nice place to hang out and do homework."

"Large, cozy cafe with great food that offers all day breakfast. Workers are pretty nice though they were strict about masks. Nice style inside the cafe."
have faster customer service and of course i was treated very coldly by the location i used to go to again for explaining my situation. think im going to stop going here. they wouldnt make it up to me at all. plus the free WiFi is horrible no matter how many times i came in bought something and sat down to do work the WiFi never connected. i kept disconnecting and connecting and it never worked plus the worker said i cant reset it very rudely towards me ugh never have i been treated with such disrespect in a place i thought i was going to be a loyal customer to i guess not. also got sick for almost a week last year due to an allergic reaction to something in one of your food items which wasnt good.  no apology or refund or free item. this place has gone downhill since i first set foot in here. may not be returning for good if this keeps happening to me.
"I really love their avacado banana smoothies, though they are a bit on the pricy side. The seating inside is comfortable, though they have a strange ranch theme. WiFi works great, staff is friendly. Price point is my only concern. The other dish I love getting from there is the hummus wrap. It's pretty good, but again, it seems a little expensive for a cafe. I'll definitely go again."

"I've had lunch here several times. The sandwiches are great partly because they have fresh bread or bagels or whatever. Prices are reasonable and the restaurant , although casual, has a very nice atmosphere. And they have good pastries and cookies."
"Simple and fast bakery, with great breakfast food and lunch sandwiches. Generally good service, fast wifi and quite good seating. There are some power outlets for us commoners who do not buy apple products. The smoothies look very good, but I haven't tried them.

THE GOOD: Bagels and egg sandwiches are pretty amazing. Farmers veggie and other lunch sandwiches are good (and quite filling) too. They are very nice people.

THE BAD: The coffee is nothing to boast about. It has gotten better, but still under what the nearby places in town offers. I would not go there for coffee only, I do go there for food and writing peace.

THE UGLY: Nothing!"

Nice place! A little over priced and bagels can be a little salty. But overall friendly staff and a good place to work and eat. Love their grain bowls especially!
"If you're from out-of-town or from out-of-state, get your coffee, breakfast, lunch, snack, soup, or whatever here. There's something cozy, relaxing and calm about this cafe. I'm not sure I could figure out why but when I was here I wanted to return back and did over and over on a rainy Sunday in early May.  Their food is delicious, the staff is friendly. I was there I think five times and I did something at this restaurant I can't remember doing at any other restaurant in my life: I took a nap."

"Perfect for any occasion: Breakfast, lunch or dinner"
"The food was delicious! Highly recommended. While we had a bit of trouble receiving one sandwich because we visited on a particularly busy day, the manager personally addressed our situation. Great customer service, and we look forward to our next visit!"
"This is the best bakery in Amherst. The food is good, prices are reasonable, per mass at least, and the cafe itself is nice actually. Honestly this is the only place I go for coffee, sandwiches, and sometimes for doing some work. All other places in downtown, yes I am talking about you Amherst Coffee, are trash in my opinion."
"I had a really delicious breakfast sandwich. The staff was friendly, my order was prepared quickly, and it was a comfortable place to sit."
The best place in the Amherst MA downtown  which is secure and follow covid social distancing measures. The food and coffee is fantastic. Staff members are nice and respecting.
"Great sandwich and smoothie shop.  Good set-up sandwiches plus you can make your own, of course.  Staff is always friendly and helpful.  The place is nice to sit in, spacious and light."
"Great smoothies, good service although not sure if it is always good we have visited twice both times when it has not been that busy. But great little place to sit and talk with friend or catch up with some work. Large venue with free WiFi. I think. The staff were very very helpful and were more than happy to explain things on the menu."
"I went there very frequently in the morning for two of the same Bagels and even would buy two dozen bagels and cream cheese every weekend for my house, but after numerous times of getting my bagel wrong I wont go anymore. I want to support a local business during a pandemic but when your employees can't care less and cannot get a simple poppy seed bagel with butter and jam right I won't go anymore. Not to mention every time I go I literally tip half the amount my bill was. Guess they don't need the business or the tips such a shame."

the best salad ever. My sister and I got the Thai chicken salad and ceaser salad and they were delicious! definitely going to come back
"I've only been here once with a friend but the coffee was cold and bad and every single food item we ordered had at least one major mistake (wrong bread, wrong toppings, etc.) :("
Wonderful selections of sandwiches. The soups and salad were also very good but I really liked the sandwich.
"My girlfriend and I often come here to do work and have lunch. It seems like the perfect place to do this, and their menu has a lot of nice options. It can get crowded, but the staff has always been friendly and I really don't have any complaints."
The manager (or employee I couldn't see a name tag) yelled at me and my friends to leave. We had a slice of pizza from Antonio's and had ordered coffee from the store and sat down outside. She then proceeded to dig out our trash and told us we couldn't throw it out there. I will NEVER go here again and neither should anyone who cares about treating customers with respect.

"Ordered two sausage egg and cheese bagels with nobody in line. After 37 minutes I asked why I hadn’t received my order. “Sorry our system didn’t process your order, this happens 3 times a day.” Didn’t get offered a refund."
"Took a latte with double shot, coffee content so less that I thought I was drinking just steamed milk. Not sure if there was any issue with the coffee machine etc, this was my only visit to the shop."
"Super fresh, very delicious! Great prices!"
"The atmosphere is comfortable enough, but the food was totally tasteless. Local goods should be bursting with flavor but my salad was utterly bland. Even the dressing had no flavor."
"A great place for morning bagels and coffee, except I tripped twice on the lip on the floor by the registers but I did not fall lol"
"Ok place but the music is too loud and festival of ""pop"" that's a soundtrack to schizophrenia."
"Excellent choices from sandwiches, soups, salads, healthy grain bowls.  Had the sesame ginger quinoa bowl.  It was really tasty."
Love this place. Kind manger. Very helpful staff. The food is great. Many options. I’m dairy and gluten free and they were super helpful helping me find food I can eat.
"Has a bit of a ""franchise"" feel to it... I wish it felt more unique and home-y. I would like to spend time doing homework there if it didn't feel so much like a fast food restaurant environment. Smoothies are good."
"Great place for breakfast, lunch, or a between-meal snack. It is located in a unit that had sat vacant for a few years, and they use the space really well, especially with the outdoor seating. Their paninis and soups are always tasty."
"Visited morning after snowstorm I was happy they were open, because Starbucks was closed.  However, service at register was inattentive, unfriendly, brusque. Bagels were very  good thankfully."
"Fresh food, tasty drinks, and friendly staff! This place reminds me of a better, more eco-conscious Panera Bread. Excellent choice for breakfast, brunch, and/or lunch."
"Salad ingredients were fresh, was a quiet respite. Pickle was great, very good peanut butter smoothie. Would have like more vegan options."
"I waited 15+ mins for a breakfast sandwich that a young lady had tried to complete but was focused on serving the customers after me, before me. I was unsatisfied and the eggs taste cheap and gross. Sorry but will not be eating here again."
"Great place to eat, but I was shocked with the experience I had when I asked the girl behind the desk to remake my wrap. She made the wrong thing for me, but get me attitude. I think customer service is about helping the customer, not disrespecting them."
This place has the best bacon and scallion cream cheese 🧀 I've ever had! Definitely recommend this place. Oh try a brain 🧠 freeze also!
I got the BBQ chicken 🐔 sandwich very tasty and quick turn around time from ordering food to receiving my food a lot of healthy food to big menu
"Delicious salad and surprisingly good iced coffee. Love the convenient location, a great place to go in my hometown area and a great place to try if you’re bored with Starbucks."
Feels less like an independent coffee shop and more like a chain. Food is mediocre. Love the chalk board for kids. Better options in town for a cafe though.
great food and very helpful staff. they have always been so good about making sure my food is safe for my allergies and their prices are always fair!
I like the barbeque chicken panini.
"Very good baked items and sandwiches. I eat there regularly. Sometimes it can be hard to find a table, but also good to go."
Love this place. Food is delicious and fresh every time I come. Staff is friendly and accommodating to dietary restrictions.
"Emphasis on local food, great smoothies. Less bagel options but lots of sandwiches sets it apart from Brueggers. Rarely long lines, lots of seating."
"Staff was friendly and the food was hot, fresh, and flavorful. Will be back to try more of the menu"
This place is amazing.  I can't say enough  good about there food and drinks 😋.
"Tasty bagels, and the coffee is drinkable, unlike Bruegger's. Friendly staff, fast service, good prices. Well worth stopping by!"
Great food at great prices and the staff is very friendly. Best food in the town of Amherst!
I had the cheapest and best bagel in my life. What an experience! Nice outdoor seating and open early!
"Probably the best bagels in town, great coffee, and the staff is always very helpful and friendly. Be sure to get a coffee punch card if you live in the area."
I have eaten at few of their locations and the food is always amazing.
Fantastic bagles. The jalapeno cheddar is excellent and the cream cheese is superior to bruggers
Good food but I waited 25+ min for a bagel and cream cheese. And they only made it after I said I was late to an appointment and needed it ASAP
A local version of Panera. Used to come here a lot but their cross contamination is problematic. Employees need better training on allergens.
The salad was SUPER fresh. Delicious mozzarella as well. Nice friendly environment.
They have this artichoke panini that I get every time! Excellent coffee too 😊
The salmon bowl is good!
Many different options there bagels are  delicious. I ordered a poppy seed bagel with reg cream cheese.
"Great breakfast and lunch menu, many really unique creative offerings. Nice and casual."
Nice little place but out of the options you have in the area it's not my first choice for coffee.
the staff here is absolutely incredible
great place to go for breakfast or lunch. They have comfortable tables to work at and a kids corner with a chalkboard and tiny table.
A very pleasant place to have coffee and quick snack and unwind.
"Awesome selection of bagels and sandwiches.  Great smoothies, and coffee drinks too!  Love it!"
Gets very crowded but has some good breakfast food
"Really good food, takes a little longer to prepare though. Still, good selection and great service"
"The food is always amazing, the staff attentive amd quick. Tj and Olanie are always working very hard to make the customers happy !!"
The soup of the day was new England clam chowder and I wanted it but I got chill instead. It was still goid but would have been better if I got what I wanted.
I like their tuna melt and green machine smoothie but the bagels are not very good so I make the 1/4 mile walk to bruggers.
"Natural foods, nice staff. In need of a lot of building maintenance, however! Dangerous flooring."
"Organic food. And good shakes. With wifi.
Banana, strawberry avocado smoothie was yummy."
Good sandwiches/panninis. Fun to split with a friend. Day old pastries an inexpensive treat.
i love being given the silent treatment by the brat over the counter just for requesting a drink tray
"Very long wait to order, but made promptly. I was only person waiting to order, and at least 5 people working."
The employees there are very friendly and it's a great spot to study.
Great one of a kind eats. Longer than average wait though but worth it in the end.
